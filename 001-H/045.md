# Pool is vulnerable to inflation attack

## Summary

In empty (or nearly empty) Pools, deposits are at high risk of being stolen through frontrunning with a "donation" to the vault that inflates the price of a share, as `deposit(uint amount)` does not have slippage control. This is variously known as a donation or inflation attack and is essentially a problem of slippage from ERC-4626 vaults.

## Vulnerability Detail

[Proof of concept](https://github.com/transmissions11/solmate/issues/178):

A malicious early user can `deposit()` with `1 wei` of `LOAN_TOKEN` as the first depositor of the Vault and get `1 wei` of shares token (`Pool` token).

Then the attacker can send `10_000e18-1` of `LOAN_TOKEN` and inflate the price per share from 1.0000 to an extreme value of 1.0000e22 (from `(1+10_000e18-1)/1`).

As a result, the future user who deposits `19_999e18` will only receive `1 wei`  (from `19_999e18*1/10_000e18`) of shares.

They will immediately lose `9999e18` or half of their deposit if they `withdraw()` right after the `deposit()`.

## Impact

Attacker is able to steal user's shares

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider requiring a minimal amount of share tokens to be minted for the first minter, and send a part of the initial mint as a permanent reserve so that the price per share can be more resistant to manipulation. OpenZeppelin calls this "virtual shares" on their attack mitigation:
