# A malicious early depositor can manipulate share price and profit from future depositors

## Summary

A malicious early depositor can manipulate share price and profit from future depositors.

## Vulnerability Detail

A malicious early depositor can deposit 1 wei of `_loanToken` as the first depositor and get 1 wei of shares.
The depositor can then send a large number of `_loanToken` and inflate the price per share to a very high amount.

Future depositors who make deposits will receive very few shares due to the manipulation.
The malicious depositor will also be able to withdraw inflated amounts for very few shares.

```solidity
    function tokenToShares (uint _tokenAmount, uint _supplied, uint _sharesTotalSupply, bool roundUpCheck) internal pure returns (uint) {
        if(_supplied == 0) return _tokenAmount;
        uint shares = _tokenAmount * _sharesTotalSupply / _supplied;
        if(roundUpCheck && shares * _supplied < _tokenAmount * _sharesTotalSupply) shares++;
        return shares;
    }
```

## Impact

Loss of funds as the malicious depositors will profit off other future depositors.

## Recommendation

Consider requiring a minimum amount of shares to be allocated for the first depositor.
