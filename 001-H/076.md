# First depositor can manipulate which causes expensive or inflate share price

## Summary

First depositor can break minting shares

## Vulnerability Detail

This is a well-known attack vector for new contracts that utilize price Per Share for accounting. This is issue where users may not receive shares in exchange for their deposits if the total asset amount has been manipulated through a large "donation". 

The first depositor into the pool can maliciously manipulate the share price by depositing the lowest possible amount (1 wei) and then artificially blowing up the token balance. Following depositors will have to supply a larger amount of tokens to receive shares > 0.

Example scenario: 
1. Alice (attacker) deposits 1 wei via `deposit()`
2. Alice receives 1 wei shares
3. Alice transfers (donates) 1000 `LOAN_TOKEN` directly to pool via transfer() to artificially blow up balance without minting new shares. Balance is now 1001 `LOAN_TOKEN` -> share price is now very high (= 1001 wei)
4. Bob has to supply larger amount of assets to receive shares

## Impact

the future user who deposits will receive tiny shares

```solidity
File: Pool.sol
199:     function tokenToShares (uint _tokenAmount, uint _supplied, uint _sharesTotalSupply, bool roundUpCheck) internal pure returns (uint) {
200:         if(_supplied == 0) return _tokenAmount;
201:         uint shares = _tokenAmount * _sharesTotalSupply / _supplied;
202:         if(roundUpCheck && shares * _supplied < _tokenAmount * _sharesTotalSupply) shares++;
203:         return shares;
204:     }
```

## Recommendation

Consider setting an initial amount of shares to mint to help mitigate this issue.
