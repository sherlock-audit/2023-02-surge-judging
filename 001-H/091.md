# when total supply is zero, at that time Almost 1/4th of first deposit can be frontrun and stolen due to rounding errors

## Summary
When totalSupply is zero an attacker goes ahead and executes the following steps

1. The attacker calls [deposit](https://github.com/Surge-fi/surge-protocol-v1/blob/b7cb1dc2a2dcb4bf22c765a4222d7520843187c6/src/Pool.sol#L307) function of suger-protocol Contract with 1 Wei underlying tokens(LoanToken) to set [userbalance](https://github.com/Surge-fi/surge-protocol-v1/blob/b7cb1dc2a2dcb4bf22c765a4222d7520843187c6/src/Pool.sol#L329) of  1 wei shares. 
2. There for the attacker balance is 1wei 
3. They transfer z underlying tokens(LoanToken)  directly to suger-protocol contract address.
    - This leads to 1 wei of balance worth z (+ some small amount) because of the [share](https://github.com/Surge-fi/surge-protocol-v1/blob/b7cb1dc2a2dcb4bf22c765a4222d7520843187c6/src/Pool.sol#L324) calculation. 
Attacker won't have any problem making this z as big as possible as they have all the claim to it as a holder of 1 Wei. 




## Vulnerability Detail
**Almost 1/4th of first deposit can be frontrun and stolen.**
- Let's assume there is a first user trying to deposit with z dollars worth of tokens
  - An attacker can see this transaction in mempool and carry out the above-described attack with x = (z/2 + 1).
    - This means the user gets 1 Wei of sharetoken which is only worth ~ 3x/4 of tokens.
    - Here, the percentage of the user funds lost depends on how much capital the attacker has. 
    - let's say a attacker keeps 2 wei share in the contract as deposit  initially instead of 1 (this makes doubles capital requirement), they can get away with 33% of the user's funds.
- Implicit minimum Amount and funds lost due to rounding errors
  - If an attacker is successful in making 1 wei of share worth X underlying tokens and a user tries to get share using k* x tokens then,
   - If k<1, then the user gets zero share. So transactions gets reverted because of amount > 0 check in deposit function 
     - This leads to an implicit minimum amount for a user at the attacker's discretion.
     - All upcoming user with k<1 will face the same issue.
  - If k>1, then users still get some share but they lose (k- floor(k)) * z) of tokens which get proportionally divided between all share  holders due to rounding errors.
This means that for users to not lose value, they have to make sure that k is an integer.

**Main Reason:**

- Calculating the [balance of user()](https://github.com/Surge-fi/surge-protocol-v1/blob/b7cb1dc2a2dcb4bf22c765a4222d7520843187c6/src/Pool.sol#L329) variable using shares, and In [share](https://github.com/Surge-fi/surge-protocol-v1/blob/b7cb1dc2a2dcb4bf22c765a4222d7520843187c6/src/Pool.sol#L324) variables _loanTokenBalance is in denominator and  [_loanTokenBalance](https://github.com/Surge-fi/surge-protocol-v1/blob/b7cb1dc2a2dcb4bf22c765a4222d7520843187c6/src/Pool.sol#L308) is calculated using **balanceof(address(this)** .
- because of that attacker is able to transfer the underlying token and attack using rounding error. 


**example**
- attacker deposit 1wei, now balance of share is 1wei.
- now attacker transfer 1e18 loan token 
- now total balance is 1e18+1 wei  .
- after that user deposit 2e18 there for user gets 2e18 share as normal scenarios 
- but here they get (3/2e18) share. 
- and also attacker got that 1/2e18 of users share 
- there fore attacker balance is 1e18wei +1wei+1/2e18wei
- and user balance is 3/2e18 



## Impact
This is pool contract, so al the upcoming new pool have same issue, that leads to infinite user funds lose 

## Code Snippet
```solidity
        uint _shares = tokenToShares(amount, (_currentTotalDebt + _loanTokenBalance), _currentTotalSupply, false);
        require(_shares > 0, "Pool: 0 shares");
        _currentTotalSupply += _shares;

        // commit current state
        balanceOf[msg.sender] += _shares;
```
attacker can manipulate the shares variable using rounding error. 
       
## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
For already deployed LPToken of vault send some LPToken to a dead address to make sure that the total supply never goes to zero
        For new LPToken, I like how[ BalancerV2](https://github.com/balancer/balancer-v2-monorepo/blob/master/pkg/pool-utils/contracts/BasePool.sol#L269-L283) and[ UniswapV2](https://github.com/Uniswap/v2-core/blob/master/contracts/UniswapV2Pair.sol#L119-L121) do it. some minimum amount of pool tokens get burnt when the first mint happens
