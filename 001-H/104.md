# Malicious depositor can inflate the shares and steal money from other lenders.

## Summary

Malicious depositor can inflate the shares and steal money from other lenders.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `deposit` operation enables users to add a specified amount of loan tokens to a pool and get a pool token in exchange. The operation then evaluates the present status of the pool based on the current loan token, pool token balances, and the pool's fees.

Subsequently, it calculates the number of pool tokens that will be given to the user for their deposited loan token via the `tokenToShares` mechanism.

The `tokenToShares` method determines the number of pool tokens that will be created when a specific amount of token is deposited into the pool based on the pool's total token balance and the overall number of pool tokens in circulation. This method may also round up the quantity of pool tokens.

The `tokenToShares` function uses distinct parameters depending on whether the use case is depositing or borrowing, although the general formula remains the same, resulting in a different outcome. When depositing, `tokenToShares` **doesn't** round up.

If I'm the first depositor in the vault and there and
`currentTotalDebt = 0`
`loanTokenBalance = 0`
`currentTotalSupply = 0`

This means that for 1 * 1e18 tokens I should be getting 1 * 1e18 shares in exchange. Of course, after there's debt, the supply/loan token balance increases/decreases, the amount of shares will increase/decrease proportionally.

Conversely, by using 1:1 ratio, this also means if I deposit 1 wei, I'll be getting 1 share in exchange.

Let's walk through the withdrawal process. The `withdraw` function allows users to withdraw their deposited loan tokens from a pool. The function calculates the current state of the pool based on the current balances of the loan token, the pool token, debt, totalSupply, etc..

The function then calculates the number of pool tokens that the user needs to return based on the amount of loan tokens being withdrawn and the current state of the pool using the `tokenToShares` function. However, in this case tokenToShares **does** round up.

The invariant here is that `shares * supplied < _tokenToAmount * _sharesToSupply`. Obviously, to break the invariant and "issue" a fake share would mean that shares needs to be 0, meaning they will get incremented to 1. 

How can we break the invariant? I hope you noticed the pool is querying the loanTokenBalance from the token itself. As a result, this opens a can full of worms.

Consider the following scenario.
1. Alice deposits 1 wei to the pool and receives 1 share in exchange.
2. Then, Alice is very generous and donates 1000e18 of loan token to the address, but by directly transferring it to the token instead of doing it through the vault.
3. Bob decides he wants to make some profit, so he deposits 1500e18 of loan tokens, but because Alice donated 1000e18 tokens, now he receives 1 share for 1500e18 tokens.
4. Alice withdraws 12501e18 tokens + 1 wei from the pool even though she deposited only 1 wei.

Why is that possible? Lets examine it step by step:
Alice needs to deposit specifically 1 wei, so she gets 1 share. The reason for that is that we want to trick the system and take advantage of the integer division precision loss in `tokenToShares`.
```soliditiy
shares * supplied < _tokenToAmount * _sharesToSupply`
```

Hence, she "donates" 1000 loan to the pool, but the pool generates no shares for these tokens, because they are added to the pool balance indirectly instead of using the deposit function. This will break all the accounting logic.

As a result, when Bob deposits 15001e18 loan tokens he gets a 1 share again, because thats how integer division works in Solidity.

$$1 share = \dfrac{15 000 000 000 000 000 000(tokensToDeposit) * (0(debt) + 1(shares))}{1000000000000000000001(loanTokenBalance)}$$

After the deposit,` shares = 2` & `loanTokenBalance = 2500e18 loan tokens + 1 wei`. Bob owns 1 share and Alice owns 1 share. The maximum amount of shares that Alice can withdraw is 1, because everything else will cause overflow due to 
`balanceOf[msg.sender] -= _shares;`

Considering that `tokenToShares` rounds up & the invariant mentioned above and given the balance of the system, how is it even possible that 

$$n(e18) * 2500e18 + 1 wei < tokensToWithdraw * 2$$

Again, we're going to use the division flaw, but this time to make it so that shares = 0, so that when it rounds up it will equal 1.

$$0 = \dfrac{15 000 000 000 000 000 000(tokensToWithdraw) * (0(debt) + 2(shares))}{2500000000000000000001(loanTokensBalance)}$$


Thanks to that, after we multiply 0 shares by supplied and as a result the shares are rounded up to 1.

Finally, even though Alice deposited 1000e18 + 1 wei, she steals 1250e18 from the pool.

## Recommendation

The attack of inflation occurs when the value of assets changes but the number of shares remains the same. This causes an increase in the value of shares, resulting in buyers getting less shares than expected. The impact of this attack is greater when the vault has low liquidity during its initial stages.

To avoid inflation attacks, I suggest using virtual shares and assets in the vault. The vault introduces 1:N virtual assets/shares to establish an initial exchange rate, which limits the effectiveness of inflation attacks. The value of N is determined by 10 raised to the power of the decimal difference (precision) between the vault and the underlying token, which is known as the offset.

The offset determines the degree of protection against attacks. An offset of 0 provides no protection, while an offset of 9 makes attacks challenging but alters the decimal value of the vault. Essentially, the offset represents the difference (in orders of magnitude) between the attacker's required funds and the user's deposited funds.
