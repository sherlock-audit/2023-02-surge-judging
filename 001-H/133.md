# First depositor can break minting of shares

## Summary

First depositor can break minting of shares.

## Vulnerability Detail

The code uses a share-like structure to calculate debts. An attacker can abuse the share structure as such: 

1. The attacker, who is the first depositor, calls deposit() and deposit 1 wei of loan tokens.

```solidity
        uint _shares = tokenToShares(amount, (_currentTotalDebt + _loanTokenBalance), _currentTotalSupply, false);
        require(_shares > 0, "Pool: 0 shares");
        _currentTotalSupply += _shares;


        // commit current state
        balanceOf[msg.sender] += _shares;
```

Since _currentTotalDebt and _loanTokenBalance is 0 and _currentTotalSupply is 0 (_supplied = 0), the function tokenToShares will return _tokenAmount (which is 1 wei passed into by the first depositor).

```solidity
    function tokenToShares (uint _tokenAmount, uint _supplied, uint _sharesTotalSupply, bool roundUpCheck) internal pure returns (uint) {
        if(_supplied == 0) return _tokenAmount;
        uint shares = _tokenAmount * _sharesTotalSupply / _supplied;
        if(roundUpCheck && shares * _supplied < _tokenAmount * _sharesTotalSupply) shares++;
        return shares;
    }
```

2. The attacker will receive 1 wei of share.
3. Next, the attacker sends 10000e18 -1 of asset tokens and inflate the price per share from 1 to 1e22
4. Subsequent depositor who deposit shares,  eg 19999e18 of assets, will only receive 1 wei of shares token
5. Victim will lose share value due to precision loss

## Impact

Subsequent depositors will get less value out of their shares.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Consider requiring a minimum amount of share tokens to be minted for the first minter or for pool creator to follow Uniswap V2 which mints 10,000 share first to balance liquidity.
