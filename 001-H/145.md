# First depositor of pool can abuse rounding error to steal tokens

## Summary
First depositor can transfer directly an amount of LOAN_TOKEN into pool to manipulate the price of shares.
 
## Vulnerability Detail
Function `Pool.deposit()` is defined as 
```solidity=
// url = https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-surge/blob/main/surge-protocol-v1/src/Pool.sol#L307-L343
function deposit(uint amount) external {
    uint _loanTokenBalance = LOAN_TOKEN.balanceOf(address(this));

    /// ... 

    uint _shares = tokenToShares(amount, (_currentTotalDebt + _loanTokenBalance), _currentTotalSupply, false);
    require(_shares > 0, "Pool: 0 shares");
    
    /// ... 
}
```
which will call `tokenToShares()` to calculate the number of shares
```solidity=
function tokenToShares (uint _tokenAmount, uint _supplied, uint _sharesTotalSupply, bool roundUpCheck) internal pure returns (uint) {
    if(_supplied == 0) return _tokenAmount;
    uint shares = _tokenAmount * _sharesTotalSupply / _supplied;

    if(roundUpCheck && shares * _supplied < _tokenAmount * _sharesTotalSupply) 
        shares++;
    return shares;
}
```
This function takes into account the `_supplied` which is comprised of the total debt and the balance of LOAN_TOKEN in pool (LOAN_TOKEN.balanceOf(address(this))). 

However, due to rounding errors, an attacker who deposits to a fresh vault can skew the ratio by transferring in a large quantity of LOAN_TOKEN by following the strategy 
1. Alice deposits 1 LOAN_TOKEN, receive 1 share in return
2. Alice then sends a large amount 1e18 wei of LOAN_TOKEN to the vault.
3. Bob comes and deposits 2e18 LOAN_TOKEN, he will receive `shares = 2e18 * 1 / (1e18+1) = 1`
4. Bob only gets minted 1 share, giving him claim to only half the vault, which has `3e18` tokens, instantly losing him `0.5e18` tokens which is profited by Alice.

## Impact
Exploit by first user of pool. Loss of tokens by other users

## Tool used
Manual review 

## Recommendation
Burn the first (if `_supplied == 0`) 10000 wei of minted shares by sending them to address 0. This will make the cost to pull of this attack unfeasable.
