# pool.sol : First depositor can influence on the share value of the other depositor who may face truncation issue.

## Summary
This issue can be faced by almost all the pool based contract. where initial depositor can deposit big amount. This will directly influence on the share value other depositors.

## Vulnerability Detail

    function tokenToShares (uint _tokenAmount, uint _supplied, uint _sharesTotalSupply, bool roundUpCheck) internal pure returns (uint) {
        if(_supplied == 0) return _tokenAmount;
        uint shares = _tokenAmount * _sharesTotalSupply / _supplied;
        if(roundUpCheck && shares * _supplied < _tokenAmount * _sharesTotalSupply) shares++;
        return shares;
    }

Pool calculates the share of deposit value as shown in above calculation. First user who deposit huge sum can decide the share values.

## Impact

Future users can be suffered by less number of shares due to truncation issue.
