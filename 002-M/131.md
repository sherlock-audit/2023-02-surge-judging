# Fee-on-transfer token used as collateral token or loan token not supported by protocol

## Summary
There are some ERC20 token implementations charge fee on each token transfer, the actual amount the pool received is less than the sepcified amount. User will get more collateral balance or minted pool tokens than he/she should have.

## Vulnerability Detail
1. Let's assume a fee-on-transfer token is used as collateral token, the fee percentage is 5%, when user calls _addCollateral()_  with specified amount 100,  the protocol will add 100 to user collateral balance whereas the actual token amount pool received is 95;
2. The same applies to _deposit()_ function, pool would mint more pool tokens for user

## Impact
User will get more collateral balance or minted pool tokens than he/she should have

## Recommendation
Consider calculating the actual amount by recording the balance before and after.
