# Pool.approve might be exposed to front running

## Summary
Pool.approve might be vulnerable to front running.

## Vulnerability Detail
The following PoC is given:
1. msg.sender calls `Pool.approve(spender, 50)`
2. msg.sender then changes its mind and instead want to change the previous approve to 100 by calling again `Pool.approve`
3. Now if the spender calls `Pool.transferFrom` before the event (2), s/he will gain the first 50 tokens, and then again 100 tokens, resulting in the first actor losing 50 tokens

## Impact
User losing funds

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The variable `Pool.allowance` should be incremented or decremented by using the ERC20 standard method `increaseAllowance()` instead of `approve()` which as shown is susceptible to front-running.
