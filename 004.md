# Initial user can skew vault ratios to steal funds from later users

## Summary
ERC4626 vaults have a well-known vulnerability, where initial user can "donate" tokens to skew the share to asset ratio in a manner where it is profitable for them. This allows them to steal funds from later users.
## Vulnerability Detail
The function `deposit` in `Pool.sol` transfers in tokens and mints to the users a number of shares representing their position. 

This can be exploited following these steps
1. Alice deposits 1 wei of LOAN token, and mints 1 wei of share
2. Alice then sends or "donates" 1e18 LOAN tokens to the contract. Contract now has 1e18+1 LOAN tokens, and has minted only 1 share
3. Bob comes along and deposits 2e18 LOAN tokens. In return, Bob gets 2e18/(1e18+1) * 1 = 1 wei of share token, due to rounding down of the floating point.
4. Alice has 1 share, Bob has 1 share. Vault has 3e18 LOAN tokens. Thus Alice can withdraw 1.5e18 tokens, gaining 0.5e18 tokens, and Bob loses the same amount
## Impact
Early user skews vault ratio and steals tokens from later user

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Contracts like uniswap V2 mitigate this by burning and permanently locking the first 1000 wei of share tokens minted. This amount is enough to prevent the vault ratios from getting that skewed.
