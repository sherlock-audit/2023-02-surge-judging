# Lack of slippage control when using tokenToShares

## Summary

Lack of slippage control when using tokenToShares

## Vulnerability Detail

When using the function below, no slippage control is implemented in-place.

```solidity
    /// @notice Converts a loan token amount to shares
    /// @param _tokenAmount The loan token amount to convert
    /// @param _supplied The total supplied loan tokens of the pool
    /// @param _sharesTotalSupply The total supply of shares of the pool
    /// @param roundUpCheck Whether to check and round up the shares amount
    /// @return uint The shares amount
    function tokenToShares (uint _tokenAmount, uint _supplied, uint _sharesTotalSupply, bool roundUpCheck) internal pure returns (uint) {
        if(_supplied == 0) return _tokenAmount;
        uint shares = _tokenAmount * _sharesTotalSupply / _supplied;
        if(roundUpCheck && shares * _supplied < _tokenAmount * _sharesTotalSupply) shares++;
        return shares;
    }
```

the parameter _supplied and _sharesTotalSupply can both change a lot before user's transaction is landed.

For example, when executing the deposit code:

```solidity
    uint _shares = tokenToShares(amount, (_currentTotalDebt + _loanTokenBalance), _currentTotalSupply, false);
    require(_shares > 0, "Pool: 0 shares");
    _currentTotalSupply += _shares;

    // commit current state
    balanceOf[msg.sender] += _shares;
```

without slippage control, the user can receive a lot less share than he expected because it is possible that before the deposit function is executed, another transaction is executed, which highly inflate the value of _currentTotalDebt + _loanTokenBalance, and make user get a lot less shares.

When executing the withdraw code:

```solidity

        uint _shares;
        if (amount == type(uint).max) {
            amount = balanceOf[msg.sender] * (_currentTotalDebt + _loanTokenBalance) / _currentTotalSupply;
            _shares = balanceOf[msg.sender];
        } else {
            _shares = tokenToShares(amount, (_currentTotalDebt + _loanTokenBalance), _currentTotalSupply, true);
        }
        _currentTotalSupply -= _shares;

        // commit current state
        balanceOf[msg.sender] -= _shares;
```

Same issue exists, with having slippage control, the user may burn more shares due to the inflation of _currentTotalDebt + _loanTokenBalance or deflation of _currentTotalSupply before the withdraw transaction is landed.

When executing the borrow code:

```solidity
    uint _shares = tokenToShares(amount, _currentTotalDebt, _debtSharesSupply, true);
        _currentTotalDebt += amount;

        // commit current state
        debtSharesBalanceOf[msg.sender] += _shares;
```

The same issue exists, the user may get more debt shares than he expected.

OR, due to sudden inflation of the _debtSharesSupply

the code does not validate _shares > 0, and it is possible that the shares amount is rounded down to 0, meaning the user is borrowing for free without accruing debts.

When executing the liquidation code:

```solidity
    if(_amount == type(uint).max || _amount == userDebt) {
        collateralReward = collateralBalance;
        _shares = debtSharesBalanceOf[_borrower];
        _amount = userDebt;
    } else {
        uint userInvertedCollateralRatioMantissa = collateralBalance * 1e18 / userDebt;
        collateralReward = _amount * userInvertedCollateralRatioMantissa / 1e18; // rounds down
        _shares = tokenToShares(_amount, _currentTotalDebt, _debtSharesSupply, false);
    }
    _currentTotalDebt -= _amount;

    // commit current state
    debtSharesBalanceOf[_borrower] -= _shares;
```

Same issue exists, liquidator can pay less debt shares due to slippage than expected while still acquiring the collateral reward.
In the most worse case, if shares is rounded down to 0, liquidator pays no debt share but still getting the collateral reward, which violates an crucial assumption: liquidation should make the account healthier.

## Impact

Missing slippage means the user can get fewer shares than he expected because the transaction that happens before intentionally modifies the supply or total shares amount (front-running) or unintentionally (another deposit transaction just happens to executes before user's transaction. )

## Recommendation

We recommend the protocol add slippage control for all function that use  tokenToShares conversion to make sure user can get the expected output amount.
