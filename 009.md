# Borrower can lose funds

## Summary
The borrower can lose funds by calling more than once the function `Pool.liquidate`, which is used to repay loan tokens debt.

## Vulnerability Detail
The function `Pool.liquidate(borrower, amount)` does calculate the amount of debt the `borrower` needs to repay only if  `amount` is equal to `amount == type(uint).max`. But if the borrower, (or the address of the borrower to repay on their behalf), does provide the exact amount of debt to pay, then the function `liquidate` does not associate the borrower's debt, thus if the borrower does call the function more than once, it absolutely can happen, than s/he will lose funds.

```solidity
        uint _shares;
        if(amount == type(uint).max) {
            amount = getDebtOf(debtSharesBalanceOf[borrower], _debtSharesSupply, _currentTotalDebt);
            _shares = debtSharesBalanceOf[borrower];
        } else {
            _shares = tokenToShares(amount, _currentTotalDebt, _debtSharesSupply, false);
        }
```

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The if condition should be adjusted by always taking in consideration the remaining debt of borrower, which is done by calling function `getDebtOf`
