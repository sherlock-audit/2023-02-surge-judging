# Pool may store the fee to address(0)

## Summary
Factory.setFeeRecipient() lack of check,  may cause all pools to store the fee to address(0), resulting in loss funds
## Vulnerability Detail
In Pool, if the factory has _feeMantissa configured, it will give part of _interest to _feeRecipient

To prevent give to address(0), when setting _feeMantissa, it will check that if _feeMantissa!=0, then _feeRecipient must also ! =address(0)

The code is as follows:
```solidity
    function setFeeMantissa(uint _feeMantissa) external {
        require(msg.sender == operator, "Factory: not operator");
        require(_feeMantissa <= MAX_FEE_MANTISSA, "Factory: fee too high");
        if(_feeMantissa > 0) require(feeRecipient != address(0), "Factory: fee recipient is zero address"); //<---------
        feeMantissa = _feeMantissa;
    }
```

But in setFeeRecipient (),  no check if _feeRecipient==address(0), then _feeMantissa can not be equal to 0, so it is still possible to _feeMantissa!=0, but feeRecipient == address(0)
setFeeRecipient():
```solidity
    function setFeeRecipient(address _feeRecipient) external {
        require(msg.sender == operator, "Factory: not operator");
        feeRecipient = _feeRecipient; //<-----@audit don't limit if _feeRecipient ==address(0) require feeMantissa!=0
    }
```

If the above description appears, it will cause Pool.sol to give the funds to address(0)


## Impact

## Recommendation
```solidity
    function setFeeRecipient(address _feeRecipient) external {
        require(msg.sender == operator, "Factory: not operator");
+       if(feeMantissa > 0) require(_feeRecipient != address(0), "Factory: fee recipient is zero address");
        feeRecipient = _feeRecipient;
    }
```
