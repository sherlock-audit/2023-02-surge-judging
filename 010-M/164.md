# `feeRecipient` could be address(0) when `_feeMantissa` > 0

## Summary

When setting `feeMantissa` in `setFeeMantissa()`, it checks whether `feeRecipient` is not `address(0)` if `feeMantissa > 0`. It prevents potentially loss of funds. However, `setFeeRecipient()` doesn’t have a corresponding check. 

## Vulnerability Detail

When setting `feeMantissa` in `setFeeMantissa()`, it checks whether `feeRecipient` is not `address(0)` if `feeMantissa > 0`.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-surge/blob/main/surge-protocol-v1/src/Factory.sol#L63
```solidity
    function setFeeMantissa(uint _feeMantissa) external {
        require(msg.sender == operator, "Factory: not operator");
        require(_feeMantissa <= MAX_FEE_MANTISSA, "Factory: fee too high");
        if(_feeMantissa > 0) require(feeRecipient != address(0), "Factory: fee recipient is zero address");
        feeMantissa = _feeMantissa;
    }
```

But `setFeeRecipient()` doesn’t have a corresponding check.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-surge/blob/main/surge-protocol-v1/src/Factory.sol#L52
```solidity
    function setFeeRecipient(address _feeRecipient) external {
        require(msg.sender == operator, "Factory: not operator");
        feeRecipient = _feeRecipient;
    }
```

Therefore, if an admin does the following step, the protocol will suffer loss of funds.
```solidity
setFeeRecipient(VALID_ADDRESS)
setFeeMantissa(0.2e18)
setFeeRecipient(address(0))
```

## Impact

Those fees would be pushed to address(0)’s balance. The protocol will suffer loss of funds. And [README.md](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-surge/blob/main/README.md) says that `There is a single fee operator role. It can only set the fee on interest (up to 20% fee) and the fee recipient address. Unexpected loss of funds due to the operator role should be considered high severity bugs`.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add a corresponding check in `setFeeRecipient`
```solidity
    function setFeeRecipient(address _feeRecipient) external {
        require(msg.sender == operator, "Factory: not operator");
        if(feeMantissa > 0) require(_feeRecipient != address(0), "Factory: fee recipient is zero address");
        feeRecipient = _feeRecipient;
    }
```
