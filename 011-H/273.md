# No gap between user's collateral ratio and the current collateral ratio

## Summary

Users are allowed to take loans at the current collateral ratio but there is no gap after that when checking in `Pool.liquidate`.

## Vulnerability Detail

User's that take a loan with current collateral ratio can get liquidated almost instantly after the loan is taken if `_currentCollateralRatioMantissa` falls with even 1 wei.

## Impact

User that have just taken a loan at the current collateral ratio can get liquidated almost instantly by bots.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
require(userCollateralRatioMantissa <= _currentCollateralRatioMantissa, "Pool: user collateral ratio too high");
```

```solidity
require(userCollateralRatioMantissa > _currentCollateralRatioMantissa, "Pool: borrower not liquidatable");
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add a gap between the user's collateral ratio and the `_currentCollateralRatioMantissa` when checking in `Pool.liquidate` or when checking in `Pool.borrow` in order to prevent users from being liquidated just after they take a loan.
