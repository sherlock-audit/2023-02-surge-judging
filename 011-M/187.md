# `feeRecipient` can be set to `address(0)` when `feeMantissa != 0`

## Summary

In the Factory contract the `feeRecipient` can be set to `address(0)` when `feeMantissa != 0` which will lead to the accrual of fee shares to the `address(0)` in the surge pools contracts.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `operator` in the Factory contract is allowed to change the `feeRecipient` and `feeMantissa` which are use to calculate and accrue fee shares in each surge pool contract.

The function `setFeeMantissa` contains a check to ensures that if we have `feeMantissa != 0` the `feeRecipient` must be non zero address to avoid accruing fees to `address(0)`, but this can still happen if the `operator` does the following :

* sets the `feeRecipient` to a given address (not `address(0)`).
* sets the `feeMantissa` to a non zero value.
* After a while the `operator` calls `setFeeRecipient` and sets the `feeRecipient` to `address(0)`.

This is possible as the function `setFeeRecipient` does not check that if `feeMantissa` is zero or not. And the `getFee()` function only checks the case where `feeMantissa == 0` but it will return a non zero `feeMantissa` even if `feeRecipient` is zero address.

Thus this will cause the accrual of fee shares to `address(0)` in all the surge pools which will dilute the shares total supply and make future users receive less shares for a given deposited amount.

## Impact

The `feeRecipient` can be set to `address(0)` when `feeMantissa != 0` which will lead to the accrual of fee shares to the `address(0)` in the surge pools contracts and thus will make future users receive less shares for a given deposited amount.

## Recommendation

To avoid this issue the `getFee()` function should also contain a check to verify that `feeRecipient != address(0)` and return a zero fee mantissa if feeRecipient is zero address, the `getFee()` function can be modified as follows

```solidity
function getFee() external view returns (address, uint) {
    uint _feeMantissa = feeMantissa;
    /** @audit
        Return (address(0), 0) if :
        _feeMantissa == 0 or feeRecipient == address(0)
    */
    if(_feeMantissa == 0 || feeRecipient == address(0)) return (address(0), 0);
    return (feeRecipient, _feeMantissa);
}
```
