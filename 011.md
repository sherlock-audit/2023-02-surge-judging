# Transfer does not check whether the msg.sender has enough tokens

## Summary
The functions transfer transfers pool tokens to a recipient. However, it does not check whether the msg.sender's balance is greater than the amount. That means that the msg.sender can inflate the balance of a recipient (such as himself) to the highest number possible.

## Vulnerability Detail
A user Bob, can call the function transfer that allows him to transfer tokens to a recipient. However, there is no check on who the address can be, so he puts his own address as the recipient. In addition, there is no check on whether he has enough tokens. So with a 0 balance he calls the function transfer to send the highest amount of tokens possible to himself


## Impact
A user can inflate his or her own balance to the maximum possible number
