# If the collateral token and loan token does not have the same decimal places, collateral ratio will be broken

## Summary

If the collateral token and loan token does not have the same decimal places, collateral ratio will be broken.

## Vulnerability Detail

The collateral ratio is calculated by taking the user's debt and dividing it by the user's collateral balance, and scaled to 1e18.

```solidity
        uint userCollateralRatioMantissa = userDebt * 1e18 / collateralBalanceOf[msg.sender];
```

If `userDebt` (loan token) is BTC which has a decimal of 1e18 and collateral balance is USDC has a decimal of 1e6, then the collateral ratio will not be scaled to 1e18.

```solidity
        require(userCollateralRatioMantissa <= _currentCollateralRatioMantissa, "Pool: user collateral ratio too high");
```

Since all the other state variables, like `_currentCollateralRatioMantissa`, is scaled to 1e18, the protocol will be broken if the collateral and loan token do not have the same decimals.

```solidity
    /// @notice Gets the pool collateral ratio in mantissa (scaled by 1e18)
    /// @param _lastCollateralRatioMantissa The last collateral ratio of the pool in mantissa (scaled by 1e18)
    /// @param _maxCollateralRatioMantissa The maximum collateral ratio of the pool in mantissa (scaled by 1e18)
    /// @param _surgeMantissa The utilization at which the surge threshold is triggered in mantissa (scaled by 1e18)
```

If the decimals of loan token is lower than the decimals of collateral token, then user collateral ratio will always be lower than current collateral ratio, and the check below will always pass.

```solidity
        require(userCollateralRatioMantissa <= _currentCollateralRatioMantissa, "Pool: user collateral ratio too high");
```

## Impact

Protocol will be broken as comparing collateral ratio will not work as expected.

## Recommendation

Make sure the two tokens have the same decimal places before anything happens.
