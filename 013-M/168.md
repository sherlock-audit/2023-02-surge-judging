# Wrong calculation of `_accruedFeeShares`

## Summary

The calculation of `_accruedFeeShares` is incorrect. The fee recipient gets more funds than it should receive.

## Vulnerability Detail


The calculation of `_accruedFeeShares` is `fee * _totalSupply / _supplied`
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-surge/blob/main/surge-protocol-v1/src/Pool.sol#L163
```solidity
        uint _interest = _totalDebt * _borrowRate * _timeDelta / (365 days * 1e18); // does the optimizer optimize this? or should it be a constant?
        // 10. Update the total debt
        _currentTotalDebt += _interest;
        
        // 11. If there is no fee, return the current values
        if(_feeMantissa == 0) return (_currentTotalSupply, _accruedFeeShares, _currentCollateralRatioMantissa, _currentTotalDebt);
        // 12. Calculate the fee
        uint fee = _interest * _feeMantissa / 1e18;
        // 13. Calculate the accrued fee shares
        _accruedFeeShares = fee * _totalSupply / _supplied; // if supplied is 0, we will have returned at step 7
        // 14. Update the total supply
        _currentTotalSupply += _accruedFeeShares;
```

But `_supplied` is not correct, `_interest` should be added to `_supplied`.

Suppose `_totalSupply` is 50, `_supplied` is 50, `_interest` is 50 and `_feeMantissa` is  2e17 (20%)
```solidity
fee = _interest * _feeMantissa / 1e18 = 50 * 2e17 / 1e18 = 10 // fee recipient should take 10 
_accruedFeeShares = fee * _totalSupply / _supplied = 10 * 50 / 50 = 10
_currentTotalSupply = 50 + 10 = 60
```
And if all the debts are repaid.
```solidity
users can withdraw
100 * 50 / 60 = 83
fee recipient can withdraw
100 * 10 / 60 = 16
```

The fee recipient should receive 10 tokens, but it receives 16 tokens.

The correct calculation should be
```solidity
_accruedFeeShares = fee * _totalSupply / ( _supplied + interest - fee) = 10 * 50 / (50 + 50 - 10) = 500 / 90 = 5

And if all the debts are repaid.
users can withdraw
100 * 50 / 55 = 90
fee recipient can withdraw
100 * 5 / 55 = 9
```

## Impact

The fee recipient gets more funds than it should receive. Users get less interest than they should receive.

## Recommendation

Correct the calculation of `_accruedFeeShares`

```solidity
        _accruedFeeShares = fee * _totalSupply / (_supplied + _interest - fee); // if supplied is 0, we will have returned at step 7
```
