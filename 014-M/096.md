# Potential DoS when a user calls repay with their total debt as the amount

## Summary

If a user calls `repay` and passes in their total debt as the amount instead of `type(uint256).max`, an attacker can front-run the transaction, calling repay with the smallest possible amount, making the users call revert.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the `repay` function, if a non-`type(uint256).max` value is passed in as the amount, it is converted to shares and then deducted from the borrower's debt shares balance.
```solidity
        _shares = tokenToShares(amount, _currentTotalDebt, _debtSharesSupply, false);
```
```solidity
        debtSharesBalanceOf[borrower] -= _shares;
```
Therefore, if a user attempts to pay off their debt by passing in their total debt balance and an attacker quickly front-runs with a call to `repay` with an amount of `1`, the users debt shares balance will underflow by when their transaction is executed.

## Impact

This can potentially create a DoS for users that attempt to pay off their full debt. While I realize there is additional functionality that allows a caller to pass in `type(uint256).max` as the amount to always specify their full debt shares balance, it can easily be missed.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add additional logic that checks if the amount passed into repay is larger than the borrower's debt share balance and adjusts the `amount` to prevent underflow.
```diff
-   if (amount == type(uint256).max) {
-       amount = getDebtOf(debtSharesBalanceOf[borrower], _debtSharesSupply, _currentTotalDebt);
+   uint256 userDebt = getDebtOf(debtSharesBalanceOf[borrower], _debtSharesSupply, _currentTotalDebt);
+   if (amount > userDebt) {
+       amount = userDebt;
        _shares = debtSharesBalanceOf[borrower];
    } else {
        _shares = tokenToShares(amount, _currentTotalDebt, _debtSharesSupply, false);
    }
```
