# Invalid finding Please disard: Smart contract should not accrue fee shares when the feeRecipient address is address(0)

## Summary

Smart contract should not accrue fees when the feeRecipient address is address(0)

## Vulnerability Detail

In the current implementation, the fee shares is accrued using the logic below, first the accuredFeeShares is calculated:

```solidity
  (  
      uint _currentTotalSupply,
      uint _accruedFeeShares,
      uint _currentCollateralRatioMantissa,
      uint _currentTotalDebt
  ) = getCurrentState(
      _loanTokenBalance,
      _feeMantissa,
      lastCollateralRatioMantissa,
      totalSupply,
      lastAccrueInterestTime,
      lastTotalDebt
  );
```

then fee is accured:

```solidity
  if(_accruedFeeShares > 0) {
      balanceOf[_feeRecipient] += _accruedFeeShares;
      emit Transfer(address(0), _feeRecipient, _accruedFeeShares);
  }
```

However, even when feeRecipient is address(0), fee is still accuring.

## Impact

First of all, fee share is lost,
secondly, the accounting of the project is impacted, because the fee shares is still accured to the current total supply

when calculating the fee shares

```solidity
// 11. If there is no fee, return the current values
if(_feeMantissa == 0) return (_currentTotalSupply, _accruedFeeShares, _currentCollateralRatioMantissa, _currentTotalDebt);
// 12. Calculate the fee
uint fee = _interest * _feeMantissa / 1e18;
// 13. Calculate the accrued fee shares
_accruedFeeShares = fee * _totalSupply / _supplied; // if supplied is 0, we will have returned at step 7
// 14. Update the total supply
_currentTotalSupply += _accruedFeeShares;
```

The state variable currentTotalSupply is used for accounting purpose, such as the code below in the deposit function

```solidity
     uint _shares = tokenToShares(amount, (_currentTotalDebt + _loanTokenBalance), _currentTotalSupply, false);
      require(_shares > 0, "Pool: 0 shares");
      _currentTotalSupply += _shares;
```

When fee recipient address is address(0), fee shares is still accured, meaning the _currentTotalSupply is an over-estimate means user can get more shares than he supposed to get, which result in incorrect accounting of the protocol. This minor deviation can add up quickly if the fee recipient address(0) is not set for a long time.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

We recommend the protocol make sure not accruing fee when feeRecipient is not set.
