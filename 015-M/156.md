# # [M-01] Free Recipient can be set to address(0)

## Summary

Despite the logic prohibiting it, the fee recipient address can still be set to address(0).

## Vulnerability Detail

When set fee rate, the `setFeeMantissa` will revert if the address of recipient is address(0).

However after setting the fee rate, the operator could mistakenly set the recipient to address(0) in function `setFeeRecipient`

## Impact

Setting address of fee recipient to address(0) results in losing fee revenue. And this fee recipient is applied to all pools, then it is important that it is correct.

## Recommendation

Add checking if recipient address is address (0) then reverts to the function `setFeeRecipient`

        require(_feeRecipient != address(0), "Factory: fee recipient is zero address")
