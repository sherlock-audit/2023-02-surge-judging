# Pool approve/transferFrom is vulnerable to race condition

## Summary

The `Pool`'s approve method overwrites the current allowance regardless of whether the spender already used it or not, so there is no way to increase or decrease allowance by certain value atomically. As a result, an attacker can spend more than the allowance in case of an allowance change.

## Vulnerability Detail

Here is a possible attack scenario:

1. Alice allows Bob to transfer N of Alice's tokens (N>0)  by calling the approve method on a Token smart contract, passing the Bob's address and N as the method arguments
2. After some time, Alice decides to change from N to M (M>0) the number of Alice's tokens Bob is allowed to transfer, so she calls the approve method again, this time passing the Bob's address and M as the method arguments
3. Bob notices the Alice's second transaction before it was mined and quickly sends another transaction that calls the transferFrom method to transfer N Alice's tokens somewhere
4. If the Bob's transaction will be executed before the Alice's transaction, then Bob will successfully transfer N Alice's tokens and will gain an ability to transfer another M tokens
5. Before Alice noticed that something went wrong, Bob calls the transferFrom method again, this time to transfer M Alice's tokens.

So, an Alice's attempt to change the Bob's allowance from N to M (N>0 and M>0) made it possible for Bob to transfer N+M of Alice's tokens, while Alice never wanted to allow so many of her tokens to be transferred by Bob.

## Impact

Attacker is able to steal more than the allowance given.

## Recommendation

Do not allow `approve` to be set from a non-zero value (N) to another non-zero value (M).
Users must first change from non-zero (N) to zero (0), then from zero (0) to non-zero (M).
