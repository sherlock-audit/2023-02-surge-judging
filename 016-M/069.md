# Approve function in Pool.sol can be frontrunned

## Summary
Approve function in Pool.sol contract at: https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-surge/blob/main/surge-protocol-v1/src/Pool.sol#L299
can allow a frontrun type of attack to steal more pool tokens than allowed 
## Vulnerability Detail
This type of vulnerability is present in the standard ERC20 implementation of the approve function. This is described here:
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YLPtQxZu1UAvO9cZ1O2RPXBbT0mooh4DYKjA_jp-RLM/edit

## Impact
A malicious user could transfer to him more pool token (than originally allowed) from a user that gave him some allowance. This happens if the user changes the malicious user allowance in a tx that is frontrunned by another tx from the malicious user (as explained in the google doc above attack scenario)

## Code Snippet
`
function approve(address spender, uint256 amount) external returns (bool) {
        allowance[msg.sender][spender] = amount; // @audit tx can be frontrunned to transferFrom the current allowed amount and later one transferFrom can be used to transfer the new allowed amount too
        emit Approval(msg.sender, spender, amount);
        return true;
    }
    `
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Two openzepplein functions can be used to mitigate the problem. One is used to increment the allowance and the other to reduce it

```solidity
function decreaseAllowance(address spender, uint256 subtractedValue) public virtual returns (bool) {
        address owner = _msgSender();
        uint256 currentAllowance = allowance(owner, spender);
        require(currentAllowance >= subtractedValue, "ERC20: decreased allowance below zero");
        unchecked {
            _approve(owner, spender, currentAllowance - subtractedValue);
        }

        return true;
    }

function increaseAllowance(address spender, uint256 addedValue) public virtual returns (bool) {
        address owner = _msgSender();
        _approve(owner, spender, allowance(owner, spender) + addedValue);
        return true;
    }
```
