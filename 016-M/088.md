# Approve function can be front-runned

## Summary

Front running is a form of exploitation in which an attacker anticipates a trade or other action on the blockchain and takes advantage of their advance knowledge by executing a trade before the original action can be completed. In the context of the approve function, front running could occur if an attacker is able to observe the transaction that calls the approve function and quickly executes a trade or other action that uses the approved tokens before the original transaction is confirmed on the blockchain. This can allow the attacker to profit at the expense of the original user.

## Vulnerability Detail

## Impact

From SWC-144:

"The ERC20 token standard includes a function called 'approve' which allows an address to approve another address to spend tokens on their behalf. Assume that Alice has approved Eve to spend n of her tokens, then Alice decides to change Eve's approval to m tokens. Alice submits a function call to approve with the value n for Eve. Eve runs a Ethereum node so knows that Alice is going to change her approval to m. Eve then submits a tranferFrom request sending n of Alice's tokens to herself, but gives it a much higher gas price than Alice's transaction. The transferFrom executes first so gives Eve n tokens and sets Eve's approval to zero. Then Alice's transaction executes and sets Eve's approval to m. Eve then sends those m tokens to herself as well. Thus Eve gets n + m tokens even thought she should have gotten at most max(n,m)."

## Code Snippet

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-surge/blob/main/surge-protocol-v1/src/Pool.sol#L299-L303

```solidity
    function approve(address spender, uint amount) external returns (bool) {
        allowance[msg.sender][spender] = amount;
        emit Approval(msg.sender, spender, amount);
        return true;
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

To prevent front running with the increaseAllowance and decreaseAllowance functions, it is important to follow the same best practices as with the approve function. Specifically, it is important to ensure that transactions are broadcast to the network in a way that minimizes the risk of them being observed by attackers before they are confirmed on the blockchain. One way to do this is to use a decentralized exchange or other platform that has measures in place to prevent front running.

Additionally, it may be helpful to implement a frontrunning protection mechanism in your smart contract code. One approach to doing this is to include a requirement that the allowance can only be increased or decreased by a certain amount within a specified time frame. This can help to prevent attackers from making rapid, consecutive calls to the increaseAllowance or decreaseAllowance functions in an attempt to front run trades or other actions.

```solidity
   function increaseAllowance(address spender, uint256 addedValue) public virtual returns (bool) {
        address owner = msg.sender
        _approve(owner, spender, allowance(owner, spender) + addedValue);
        return true;
    }


    function decreaseAllowance(address spender, uint256 subtractedValue) public virtual returns (bool) {
        address owner = msg.sender
        uint256 currentAllowance = allowance[owner][spender];
        require(currentAllowance >= subtractedValue, "Pool: decreased allowance below zero");
        unchecked {
            _approve(owner, spender, currentAllowance - subtractedValue);
        }

        return true;
    }
```
