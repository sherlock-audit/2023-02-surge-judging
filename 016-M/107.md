# A malicious User can steal the funds of others with TransferFrom

## Summary
The function TransferFrom allows a user to send funds on the behalf of another. However, it makes no check on whether the msg.sender has enough allowance to spend tokens on another's behalf. Therefore, a malicious user can directly steal funds from another

## Vulnerability Detail
The function TransferFrom allows a user to send funds on the behalf of another. It first reduces the allowance of the msg.sender shown here. 
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-surge/blob/main/surge-protocol-v1/src/Pool.sol#L286

The allowance of the msg.sender to spend another user's token is set in the allowance function:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-surge/blob/main/surge-protocol-v1/src/Pool.sol#L299-L303

After the allowance is reduced, the function TransferFrom then reduces the balance of the User, and increases the balance of the msg.sender shown here 

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-surge/blob/main/surge-protocol-v1/src/Pool.sol#L287-L290

However, there is no check on whether a user has an allowance high enough to call TransferFrom.

Lets say that a user Bob has a balance of 10. A malicious user, Alice, can steal the funds of Bob by calling transferFrom. Bob did not approve Alice to spend his balance. However, since the function does not check whether Alice has a high enough balance she can directly steal Bob's funds.

When Alice calls TransferFrom, the allowance is reduced, however, Alice's allowance is already 0. The function doesn't check this, it only reduces it, so the allowance remains 0 (0-10 = 0). However, Bob's balance of 10 is reduced and Alice's balance is increased by 10. Alice has stolen Bob's funds.

## Impact
User funds can directly be stolen

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add a check to see if the allowance is less than or equal to the amount 

e.g. 
```require amount <= allowance[from][msg.sender], "allowance not high enough"; ```
