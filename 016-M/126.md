# Pool tokens are susceptible to double use of an allowance

## Summary
Because there is only an `approve()` function for Pool tokens, they are vulnerable to the well known double spend attack.

## Vulnerability Detail
Consider this scenario:
1) Alice allows Bob to transfer N of Alice's Pool tokens (N>0)  by calling the `Pool.approve()` method.
2) After some time, Alice decides to change from N to M (M>0) the number of Alice's tokens Bob is allowed to transfer, so she calls the `approve()` method again, this time with M as the approval amount.
3) Bob notices Alice's second transaction before it is mined and quickly sends another transaction that calls the `Pool.transferFrom()` method to transfer N of Alice's tokens away.
4) If Bob's transaction is executed before Alice's transaction, then Bob will successfully transfer N of Alice's Pool tokens and will gain an ability to transfer another M Pool tokens.
5) Before Alice notices this, Bob calls the `transferFrom()` method again, this time to transfer M of Alice's Pool tokens.

## Impact
As in the example, a user may find that twice the expected allowance has been spent when they only intended to make a small adjustment to an allowance.

One possible solution to mitigate this race condition is to first reduce the spenderâ€™s allowance to 0 and set the desired value afterwards. However, this requires the user to be aware of this risk and also requires the user to be willing to spend gas on two transactions instead of one.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement `increaseAllowance()` and `decreaseAllowance()` functions in `Pool` similar to those in the [OpenZeppelin ERC20](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/api/token/erc20#ERC20) library.
