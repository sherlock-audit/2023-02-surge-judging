# Pool token approve race condition

## Summary
approve() in the Pool contract is vulnerable to race condition

## Vulnerability Detail
approve() is the only function that allows a user to set allowance of pool token, there's no function like increaseAllowance() or decreaseAllowance()

If user A has approved user B to transfer 10 tokens, then later changed his mind and decreased the allowance to 5 tokens using approve(), user B can front run the approve() transaction by user A and first transfer the 10 tokens away, then after the approve() by user A is executed user B will have another 5 tokens allowance, and user B can transfer a total of 15 tokens from user A

## Impact
Malicious users can front run the approve() function call that is going to decrease allowance for them, and transfer more tokens from the victim than expected

## Code Snippet
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-surge/blob/main/surge-protocol-v1/src/Pool.sol#L299-L303
```solidity
    /// @notice Approves an address to spend pool tokens on behalf of the sender
    /// @param spender The address of the spender
    /// @param amount The amount of pool tokens to approve
    /// @return bool that indicates if the operation was successful
    function approve(address spender, uint amount) external returns (bool) {
        allowance[msg.sender][spender] = amount;
        emit Approval(msg.sender, spender, amount);
        return true;
    }
```

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement functions like increaseAllowance() and decreaseAllowance()
