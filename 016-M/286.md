# approve() function can be front run by the spender

## Summary
 in Pool.sol the `approve()` function can be front run by the spender to get more allowance to spend
## Vulnerability Detail
The `approve` function can be front run to give the spender more allowance to spend on because if let's say person A calls the approve function to approve person B to spend 10 shares of pool token on behalf of person A.  Then person A  decides to lower the amount of allowance person B gets from 10 shares to 5 shares. person B, sees this on the mempool and then decides to front run person A's transaction by calling `tranferFrom()` to transfer 10 shares of pool tokens to an address. When person A's transaction is finished, person B then gets another 5 shares of allowance to transfer.
## Impact
person A will get more allowance to spend
