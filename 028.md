# A malicious depositor can systematically manipulate utilisation rate to bring the collateral ratio to the level she wants

## Summary

Liquidation scenario for any normal borrowing is dependent on the price of borrowed asset viz-a-viz collateral posted. Surge was created to prevent price manipulations of illiquid tokens - however the current implementation opens up a new attack vector, collateral ratio manipulation by a malicious depositor

A depositor can have undue influence on the fate of a borrowing because she can influence the utilisation rate. A malicious depositor can force liquidations by systematically withdrawing from the pool (and hence changing the loan token supply in pool). 

## Vulnerability Detail
Utilisation rate is defined as the total debt issued by the total loan tokens supply. Supply here is equal to the sum of total debt plus the amount of loan tokens in the pool

```solidity
    function getUtilizationMantissa(uint _totalDebt, uint _supplied) internal pure returns (uint) {
        if(_supplied == 0) return 0;
        return _totalDebt * 1e18 / _supplied;
    }
```

All things equal, if a depositor withdraws loan tokens from pool, utilization rate increases. A utilization rate that was just under surge threshold can be pushed beyond that level if a large withdrawal is initiated by a depositor.

Notice that the `slope` of collateral ratio is positive below surge threshold & negative above surge threshold. A depositor can plan her withdrawal in such a way such that she can keep utilisation above surge threshold for a specific time period.

Since collateral ratio decreases at a fixed rate (shown below), by keeping utilisation above surge threshold for a desired period, a malicious depositor can make collateral ratio end up where she wants. This will allow her to liquidate any borrower (ofcourse, within a specific range)

```solidity
    uint timeDelta = _now - _lastAccrueInterestTime;
    uint change = timeDelta * _maxCollateralRatioMantissa / _collateralRatioFallDuration;
```

## Impact
Let's look at a POC to understand this better

- Let's say Alice is a depositor in `DAI (loan token) - USDC (collateral token)` pool
- Pool has 10 million DAI deposited with Alice being largest depositor at 3 million DAI
- Max collateral ratio is 0.8, surge threshold - 80%
- Bob, Marley have borrowed 5 million & 2.5 million at collateral ratios of 0.6 & 0.4 respectively
- Collateral ratio fall duration = collateral ratio recovery duration = 4 days

Alice has a target of liquidating Bob - let's see how she can execute this..

- Current utilisation rate = 75%
- Alice withdraws 1 million DAI - new utilisation = 83.33% (7.5 / 9) exceeds surge which in-turn causes a drop in collateral ratio
- Every time a new depositor comes in, Alice matches a withdrawal equal to fresh deposit. This keeps utilisation at same level & continues the fall in collateral ratio
- Exactly in 1 day, collateral ratio falls to 0.6. Assuming Bob has not taken any action (ie. added new collateral), Bob gets liquidated
- Once this is achieved, Alice deposits the amount withdrawn to push the utilisation back under surge threshold
- Collateral ratio increases back to max collateral ratio (all else equal) over next day

Alice could perform a targeted attack on Bob by dropping collateral ratio to the exact level she wanted & reversing that once her objective is achieved. Key vulnerability here is to allow a depositor to withdraw into a surge.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Revert a withdrawal if it causes a utilisation to push beyond surge threshold. Just like protocol is not allowing a new borrowing once utilisation exceeds surge, a similar restriction needs to be imposed on withdrawals (which also tend to have the same effect)
