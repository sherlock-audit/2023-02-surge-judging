# Positive feeMantissa WIth Zero feeRecipient

## Summary

The `feeMantissa` in `Factory.sol` can be positive (non-zero) while the `feeRecipient` is set to `address(0)` despite restrictions in `setFeeMantissa`.

## Vulnerability Detail

```Solidity
function setFeeMantissa(uint _feeMantissa) external {
    require(msg.sender == operator, "Factory: not operator");
    require(_feeMantissa <= MAX_FEE_MANTISSA, "Factory: fee too high");
    if(_feeMantissa > 0) require(feeRecipient != address(0), "Factory: fee recipient is zero address");
    feeMantissa = _feeMantissa;
}
```

The `setFeeMantissa` function seen above has a require statement that is triggered if the `_feeMantissa` is non-zero making sure the current `feeRecipient` is not the zero address. It is assumed this is done to prevent the burning of fees (loss of funds). The only problem is that this can be easily circumvented through the `setFeeRecipient` function seen below: 

```Solidity
function setFeeRecipient(address _feeRecipient) external {
    require(msg.sender == operator, "Factory: not operator");
    feeRecipient = _feeRecipient;
}
```

**Path**
The `operator`:
1. Sets the `feeRecipient` to any non-zero address by calling `setFeeRecipient`.
2. Calls `setFeeMantissa` with a non-zero `_feeMantissa` (works because `feeRecipient` is currently non-zero).
3. Sets the `feeRecipient` back to the zero address by calling `setFeeRecipient`.


## Impact

Fee funds can be burned (lost forever) if the Factory `operator` decides to grief.

## Recommendation

If it is desired to not have a positive `feeMantissa` with a zero address `feeRecipient`, do not allow `_feeRecipient` to be the zero address with a positive `feeMantissa` in `setFeeRecipient`.
