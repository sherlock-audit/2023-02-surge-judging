# [M-1] Division before multiplication in Pool.sol is susceptible to precision loss

## Summary

In Pool.sol, multiplication occurs on the result of a division. This is the same as dividing before multiplying.

## Vulnerability Detail

Multiplication before leads to loss of precision and truncation issues since solidity doesn't allow floating point numbers.

## Impact

Small rounding errors can result in a significant amount of incorrect `accruedFeeShares` transferred to the fee recipient.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Refactor the _interest, fee, and _accruedFeeShares formulas so that multiplication is performed first and division is performed last.
