# Certain parameter choices lead to protocol becoming bricked and unfixable in surge mode

## Summary

There exist parameter choices that allow the protocol to function normally until it enters surge mode. At this point it will become bricked to further interaction, causing loss of funds to users and no way to rescue it from surge mode.

## Vulnerability Detail

If the `SURGE_MANTISSA` parameter is greater than `1e18` then the `getBorrowRateMantissa` function will revert with an underflow in surge mode only. This function is in the call chain of every user facing external function. Therefore the contract will be unusable, funds will be irrecoverable, and there will be no way to return to as normal mode of operations.

`(1e18 - _surgeMantissa)` underflows if `_surgeMantissa > 1e18`, causing a revert.

Large SURGE_MANTISSA variables are very reasonable. If the collateral token is WETH and the loan token is DAI, then a max collateralization ratio of $3000 worth of dai borrowable per eth would require a SURGE_MANTISSA of `3000e18`.

## Impact

DoS of the protocol and loss of user funds.

## Recommendation

Add input validation to make sure surge mantissa is set to a value `<= 1e18`.
