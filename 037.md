# Pools will be broken if tokens have different decimal amounts

## Summary

Pool parameters are expressed in mantissa form, scaled by 1e18. A utilization threshold of 50% is specified to surge pools at `0.5e18`. This 18 decimal format is hardcoded in many places in the codebase. However, if a pool is created with 2 tokens that do not share a decimal amount, thus not canceling eachother out in operations, then the accounting will not be correct. For example, utilization ratios may never be hit.

## Vulnerability Detail

In many places in the codebase, amounts of the `LOAN_TOKEN` and `COLLATERAL_TOKEN` are directly compared without accounting for decimals and then arbitrarily scaled by `1e18`. This scaling is meant to bring the ratios to `1e18` scale to be easily compared with the `1e18`-scaled parameters (utilization ratio, collateralization ratio, etc).

However, if the two tokens do not share an amount of decimals then the accounting in the protocol will be incorrect.

For example, consider a pool with a LOAN_TOKEN of USDC (6 decimals) and COLLATERAL_TOKEN of WETH (18 decimals). Then the `lastTotalDebt` state variable will be in terms of 6 decimals and users' `collateralBalanceOf` will be in 18 decimals.

The limit on the USDC/WETH pool could be 100e18, to specify that 100USDC may be borrowed per WETH. This 1e18 scaling is forced by the codebase by hardcoding it in many calculations. However a user would then be able to actually borrow $1e12 worth USDC per WETH. If the deployer tried to account for this, the accounting would break in other places like the section of the borrow() function linked above.

A pool creator cannot get around this because the `1e18` scale is hardcoded throughout the protocol, with the assumption that LOAN and COLLATERAL tokens' decimals cancel out and parameters are set in `1e18`. 

## Impact

Loss of funds. This is very similar to Notional H-1 https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2022-12-notional-judging/issues/18

## Recommendation

Allow users to specify the mantissa decimal amount. Avoid hardcoding `1e18` scale throughout the codebase.
