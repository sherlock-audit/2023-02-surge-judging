# Protocol is unable to keep up with real world price changes.

## Summary

The Surge protocol calculates the loan:collateral exchange rate as a "collateralization ratio" (cRatio). Pool deployers specify the collateralization ratio update curve by defining a max and min point. If the utilization is above a "surge threshold" then the cRatio increases linearly towards the max, if the utilization is below surge, then the cRatio decreases linearly towards 0. The change is linear with respect to time.

However, real world price changes are not linear. If the price of a loan token changes superlinearly with respect to a collateral token then surge will not be able to keep up with the change. Users would then be able to profitably drain the pool by borrowing at stale exchange rates.

Other lending markets with linearly changing cRatios get around this by using price oracles for exchange rates. However Surge overloads the cRatio by also using it as an exchange rate. 

Furthermore, the max, min and slope parameters are hardcoded into a pool and cannot be adjusted in the case of regime change.

## Vulnerability Detail

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-surge/blob/main/surge-protocol-v1/src/Pool.sol#L216-L263

The `getCollateralRatioMantissa` can only express cRatio changes over time as series of linear updates by `_maxCollateralRatioMantissa / _collateralRatioRecoveryDuration` and `_maxCollateralRatioMantissa / _collateralRatioFallDuration`. However the most common rates of exchange rate updates are **not linear**. 

Pool deployers have to immutably choose these parameters, including an absolute maximum exchange rate at deploy time. The pool collateralization ratio will very soon become stale and will not be able to update with real-world prices.

## Impact

Loss of funds to pool liquidity providers.

## Recommendation

Allow threshold changes or update the collateralization ratio curve to more closely match real world usage patterns. For example consider the curves used by Curve Protocol.
