# Missing nonReentrant modifier

## Summary
These reentrncy attacks occur when a malicious contract is able to repeatedly call back into the vulnerable contract before the previous call has finished executing. This can lead to unexpected behavior and allow the attacker to manipulate the state of the vulnerable contract.

## Vulnerability Detail

## Impact
The impact of missing the nonReentrant modifier can be severe. An attacker can repeatedly call back into the vulnerable contract and manipulate its state in unexpected ways. This could lead to funds being stolen or the contract becoming unusable. 

The following functions are missing reentrancy modifier, it can be reenter the functions.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
To prevent reentrancy attacks, developers can use a pattern known as the "nonReentrant" modifier. This modifier ensures that a function can only be called once at a time, preventing any further calls until the first call has completed. Without this modifier, a reentrancy attack could be used to exploit the vulnerable contract.
