# If price declines faster than the pool's collateral rate, a pool can become locked in insolvency

## Summary
It is easily possible for the collateral token's value to decline faster than the pool's collateral rate.

In this circumstance, liquidators would lose money on liquidations and so would have no reason to liquidate.

Likewise, borrowers would have no incentive to repay.

This could lock the utilisation rate at a high value if there are multiple insolvent loans at a high collateralisation rate.

## Vulnerability Detail
Consider the following scenario:
- The loan token is USDC.
- The collateral token is the (fictional) RRR.
- At the pool's creation, RRR is trading at $70. The pool is created with a starting collateralisation ratio of 50:1.
- The `COLLATERAL_RATIO_FALL_DURATION` is 3 days to go to a `MIN_RATE` of 0.
- A number of users deposit USDC.
- Alice deposits RRR and borrows USDC at a ratio of 50:1.
- Bob deposits RRR and borrows USDC at a ratio of 20:1.
- The price of RRR quickly lurches down to $40 within 2 hours. Users withdraw USDC, pushing the utilisation rate well past the surge ratio.
- However, Alice has no reason to repay her USDC and other users have no incentive to liquidate Alice: in both cases, buying RRR for $50 is loss making.
- Bob believes he is safe but does not realise that the collateral ratio will continue to decline because the pool is locked in insolvency / high utilisation.
- New users will not deposit USDC because it would not earn interest: it would immediately be withdrawn by those users who deposited the USDC that Alice currently has.

## Impact
There are two parties who lose out in this scenario:

1) The users who deposited the USDC borrowed by Alice will lose their USDC.
2) Bob will be liquidated at 20:1 even though RRR has a value of 40:1.

## Code Snippet
They key section of code is [the calculation of the liquidation reward](https://github.com/Surge-fi/surge-protocol-v1/blob/b7cb1dc2a2dcb4bf22c765a4222d7520843187c6/src/Pool.sol#L585-L587) which simply calculates the ratio of the user's collateral to their debt. This is the [same ratio](https://github.com/Surge-fi/surge-protocol-v1/blob/b7cb1dc2a2dcb4bf22c765a4222d7520843187c6/src/Pool.sol#L474) that the user borrows at.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
One method to mitigate this issue would be adding an incentive to liquidations so that a borrower would have to deposit at, say, 40:1 to be able to borrow at 30:1. The extra collateral tokens would then be paid to liquidators.
