# Pool does not conform to ERC-20 standard

## Summary

In `Pool.sol`, the `totalSupply` is different than the sum of `balanceOf` all addresses.

## Vulnerability Detail

Whenever fees are accrued by the Pool, the `_feeRecipient` balance is incremented, but the `totalSupply` is not. As a result, the `totalSupply` will be smaller than the sum of `balanceOf` of all users. This happens on `deposit`, `withdraw`, `removeCollateral`, `borrow` and `repay`.

## Impact

Protocols integrating with the `Pool` token might be affected by this accounting error.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Make `Pool` extend from `ERC20.sol` from [OpenZeppelin](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol) and use the internal methods `_mint` and `_burn` to handle issuance of shares to addresses, as they will correctly take care of the internal accounting system of the token.
