# Does not consider  that the difference in precision between loan token and collateral token may cause the user will be not able to borrow tokens.

## Summary
The protocol does not consider  that the difference in precision between loan token and collateral token , if  the loan token is WETH ( the decimal of WETH is 18) and collateral token is USDT (the decimal of WETH is 6).  user will be not able to borrow loan tokens.

## Vulnerability Detail
The protocol allows user to add collateral tokens and borrow loan tokens. When user call the function ```borrow()``` to borrow loan tokens ,the protocol will calculate  user collateral ratio and the ratio should less than ```_currentCollateralRatioMantissa```. The ```userCollateralRatioMantissa``` is calculated according to this formula ```uint userCollateralRatioMantissa = userDebt * 1e18 / collateralBalanceOf[msg.sender];```. However, if the loan token is WETH ( the decimal of WETH is 18) and collateral token is USDT (the decimal of WETH is 6). The user collateral ratio will be ```userCollateralRatioMantissa  = x*1e18*1e18/y1e6```. The decimal of result will be 30 and it is greater than ```_currentCollateralRatioMantissa``` (the decimals is 18). User will be not able to complete the borrowing.


```solidity
  function borrow(uint amount) external {
        uint _loanTokenBalance = LOAN_TOKEN.balanceOf(address(this));
        (address _feeRecipient, uint _feeMantissa) = FACTORY.getFee();
        (  
            uint _currentTotalSupply,
            uint _accruedFeeShares,
            uint _currentCollateralRatioMantissa,
            uint _currentTotalDebt
        ) = getCurrentState(
            _loanTokenBalance,
            _feeMantissa,
            lastCollateralRatioMantissa,
            totalSupply,
            lastAccrueInterestTime,
            lastTotalDebt
        );

        uint _debtSharesSupply = debtSharesSupply;
        uint userDebt = getDebtOf(debtSharesBalanceOf[msg.sender], _debtSharesSupply, _currentTotalDebt) + amount;
        uint userCollateralRatioMantissa = userDebt * 1e18 / collateralBalanceOf[msg.sender];
        require(userCollateralRatioMantissa <= _currentCollateralRatioMantissa, "Pool: user collateral ratio too high");

        uint _newUtil = getUtilizationMantissa(_currentTotalDebt + amount, (_currentTotalDebt + _loanTokenBalance));
        require(_newUtil <= SURGE_MANTISSA, "Pool: utilization too high");
```

## Impact
Users will be not able to complete the borrowing.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Depending on the precision of each Token, the ratio is calculated dynamically
