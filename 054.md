# Pool exchange rate can never increase

## Summary

Collateralization ratios may quickly become permanently stale as the maximum value must be set to the same at the initial value.

## Vulnerability Detail

In Surge the collateralization ratio represents the amount of LOAN_TOKEN that can be borrowed for every wei of COLLATERAL_TOKEN posted. In this sense it represents not only the collateralization amount but also the exchange rate, because the ratio is directly between wei of the loan and collateral token, instead of being translated to dollars.

A user who initializes a pool where the collateral token is WETH and the loan token is USDC may notice that the market rate of WETH is 4000USDC. To be safe they set up a pool such that the current collateralization ratio is 3000e18, such that only 3000USDC may be borrowed for every WETH posted as collateral. 

If it is the case that ETH becomes worth 10,000USDC then it is beneficial to borrowers and depositors for the collateralization ratio to increase with this rate.

A crucial function of surge is a collateralization ratio that changes with demand, accounting for price changes. However the mechanism responsible for increasing the collateralization ratio cannot accommodate this situation, because the initial collateralization Ratio is set to the same value as the max. As seen above, where in the constructor the initial collateralization ratio is set to be equal to the maximum value. This means that the range of valid values will forever be (0, initial). 

Even pool deployers who foresee this case cannot account for it, because they would not want to set the initial collateralization ratio to 7000USDC at deploy time. 

Instead the maximum should be above the initial value, to allow for fluctuations up along with down.

## Impact

Pool collateralization ratios do increase with rising exchange rates and the pool becomes stale, losing fees for depositors and functionality for borrowers.

This is very similar to https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-01-cooler-judging/issues/217 where a hardcoded maximum collateralization value renders a contract useless, except it's even worse because in this case the initial and the maximum must be the same.

## Recommendation

Allow an initial collateralization ratio to be set that is separate from the maximum.
