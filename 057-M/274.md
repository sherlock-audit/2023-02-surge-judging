# There is no liquidation incentive if `maxCollateralRatioMantissa >= 1e18`

## Summary
There is no incentive for liquidators if `maxCollateralRatioMantissa >= 1e18`

## Vulnerability Detail
The collateral reward sent back to a liquidator is computed as follow:

```solidity
File: src/Pool.sol
579:         uint collateralReward;
580:         if(_amount == type(uint).max || _amount == userDebt) {
581:             collateralReward = collateralBalance;
582:             _shares = debtSharesBalanceOf[_borrower];
583:             _amount = userDebt;
584:         } else {
585:             uint userInvertedCollateralRatioMantissa = collateralBalance * 1e18 / userDebt;
586:             collateralReward = _amount * userInvertedCollateralRatioMantissa / 1e18; // rounds down
587:             _shares = tokenToShares(_amount, _currentTotalDebt, _debtSharesSupply, false);
588:         }
```

In the case of a full liquidation,   `collateralReward == collateralBalance`.

There is no additional incentive amount sent to the liquidator. This is a problem in cases when `maxCollateralRatioMantissa >= 1e18`: there is absolutely no incentive for users to call `liquidate`, as the collateral they would receive would be the same value as their repay amount.

## Impact
It affects pool in the edge case where `maxCollateralRatioMantissa == 1e18`.

Looking at pool deployments, the only requirement on `_maxCollateralRatioMantissa` is the following:
```solidity
63:         require(_maxCollateralRatioMantissa > 0, "Pool: _maxCollateralRatioMantissa too low");
```

Meaning this is a valid edge case to look at.

## Recommendation
Consider creating a liquidation incentive system, where perhaps some of the balances of liquidity providers would be deducted to reward liquidators during liquidations.
