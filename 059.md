# Pool not compatible with fee-on-transfer tokens can result in loss of funds for the user

## Summary
The pool is not compatible with fee on transfer tokens, which in a specific case can result to direct loss of money for the user.

## Vulnerability Detail

The protocol docs state that
> Loan and collateral contracts are considered by the Pool contracts as trusted, ERC20-compliant and non-rebasing token contracts.

However, there are some tokens take a transfer fee (e.g. `STA`, `PAXG`), some do not currently charge a fee but may do so in the future (e.g. `USDT`, `USDC`).

My understanding is that non-rebasing tokens != fee on transfer tokens, as [mentioned](https://bytes032.xyz/Notes/ERC20+-+Rebasing+%26+Fee-On-Transfer) here.

From my point of view, the impact of the vulnerability has two parts:
1. Bricking the whole pool except for the possibility of adding collateral
2. If a user deposits `n` amount of collateral or loan token, he's never going to be able to get it back.

Last, but not least its breaking this invariant from the docs
> Lenders and borrowers should never suffer a precision loss higher than 1/1e18 of their expected return.

## Impact

I have extended the protocol's MockERC20, by adding the fee functionality. An example using an amount as small as 1 wei is enough to represent that all the test cases are failing.

```solidity

contract ERC20Fee {
    uint8 public immutable decimals;
    uint public immutable totalSupply;
    mapping (address => uint) public balanceOf;
    mapping (address => mapping (address => uint)) public allowance;
    uint256 fee;

    constructor (uint supply, uint8 _decimals) {
        decimals = _decimals;
        balanceOf[msg.sender] = totalSupply = supply;
        fee = 1 wei;
    }

    function transfer(address to, uint amount) public returns (bool) {
        balanceOf[msg.sender] -= amount;
        balanceOf[to] += amount - fee;
        balanceOf[address(0)] += fee;
        return true;
    }

    function approve(address spender, uint amount) public returns (bool) {
        allowance[msg.sender][spender] = amount;
        return true;
    }

    function transferFrom(address from, address to, uint amount) public virtual returns (bool) {
        allowance[from][msg.sender] -= amount;
        balanceOf[from] -= amount;
        balanceOf[to] += amount - fee;
        balanceOf[address(0)] += fee;
        return true;
    }
}

```

What's making it worse is that potentially anybody that adds a `n` amount of collateral or loan tokens is never going to be able to withdraw it. 

I have proven both points by using partial functionality of the protocol's existing test suite.


```solidity
    function testBorrow() external {
        uint amount = 1e36;
        uint borrowAmount = amount / 2;
        ERC20Fee collateralToken = new ERC20Fee(amount, 18);
        ERC20Fee loanToken = new ERC20Fee(amount, 18);
        Pool pool = factory.deploySurgePool(IERC20(address(collateralToken)), IERC20(address(loanToken)), 1e18, 0.5e18, 1e15, 1e15, 0.1e18, 0.4e18, 0.6e18);
        loanToken.approve(address(pool), type(uint).max);
        collateralToken.approve(address(pool), type(uint).max);
        pool.deposit(amount);
        pool.addCollateral(address(this), borrowAmount);
        // ... //
    }
```

```solidity
    function testDepositWithdraw() external {
        uint amount = 1e36;
        ERC20Fee collateralToken = new ERC20Fee(amount, 18);
        ERC20Fee loanToken = new ERC20Fee(amount, 18);
        Pool pool = factory.deploySurgePool(IERC20(address(collateralToken)), IERC20(address(loanToken)), 1e18, 0.8e18, 1e15, 1e15, 0.1e18, 0.4e18, 0.6e18);
        loanToken.approve(address(pool), amount);
        pool.deposit(amount);
        // .... //
    }
```

In both cases, the tests are passing with flying colors. As a result, I consider the impact of this vulnerability is high, as users can lose tokens with no way of recovering them.

## Tool used

Manual review


## Recommendation

The protocol team should either add support for fee on transfer tokens or explicitly document that fee on transfer tokens are not supported. I think it's worth taking a look how [Uniswap](https://docs.uniswap.org/contracts/v2/reference/smart-contracts/common-errors) handles that
