# Possible race condition when using the approve functionality

## Summary

Surge is lending pool that allows users to borrow and lend funds without the need for intermediaries. The platform offers a single collateral and loan token pair, where borrowers can deposit their collateral token and borrow the loan token or lenders deposit loan tokens and potenetially generate profit for them.

When borrowers deposit loan tokens, they get pool tokens in exchange which can exchanged between users using the `transfer` and `transferFrom` functions. As we all know, the `transferFrom` function can only be used if there's an issued allowance by using the `approve` function.

Unfortunately, there's a well known vulnerability with front running the approve function as mentioned in the following resources: [1](https://github.com/0xProject/0x-monorepo/issues/850), [2](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YLPtQxZu1UAvO9cZ1O2RPXBbT0mooh4DYKjA_jp-RLM/edit), [3](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/738#issuecomment-336424511), [4](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/issues/438#issuecomment-329172399), [5](https://blog.smartdec.net/erc20-approve-issue-in-simple-words-a41aaf47bca6), [6](https://www.adrianhetman.com/unboxing-erc20-approve-issues/)


## Vulnerability Detail

1. Alice, a close friend of Bob, allows him to spend 100 tokens by calling approve("Bob", 100). However, she changes her mind & wants to reduce the allowance to 50 by making a second call, approve("Bob", 50).
2. Bob, a tech-savvy individual monitoring the mempool, quickly spots Alice's second transaction & calls transferFrom("Alice, 100"). Additionally he prioritizes it by setting a high fee to ensure it gets executed before Alice's second transaction - approve("Bob", 50), revealing his greedy nature.
3. Even though the call flow was approve("Bob", 100) approve("Bob, 50) transferFrom("Bob", "Alice", 100) Bob's prioritization of a high fee led to this outcome ðŸ‘‡

4. As a result, Bob transferred 100 tokens to himself & gained a new allowance of 50 tokens. He takes them from Alice by calling transferFrom("Alice", "Bob", 50). This leaves Alice with a loss of 150 tokens & a lost friend.


## Impact

Potential loss of funds for anybody approving spenders. Since this is definitely doable, but I would assume that the "spender" is at least somewhat trusted, I am rating this as a medium.

Manual review


## Recommendation

Some devs AND tokens (Tether) are using this check started using this check. This check tries to encourage Alice to change Bob's allowance from N to zero and then from zero to M, instead of changing it from N to M directly.

Many believed that this way is safer because it makes it impossible for Bob to transfer N+M tokens. Actually, this way is only slightly safer, if safer at all. Actually, even if Alice would change allowance from N to zero and then from zero to M, Bob still may transfer N+M of her tokens. Check out [this](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/issues/438#issuecomment-329172399) GH issue if you want to read more about this scenario.

So, my recommendation is to take inspiration from OZ's ERC20 implementation and add [increaseAllowance](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol#L177) & [decreaseAllowance](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol#L197) to the pool.
