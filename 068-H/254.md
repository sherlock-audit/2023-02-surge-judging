# Users can be Unfairly Liquidated When _collateralRatioFallDuration Is Low

## Summary

Surge pools with a high _collateralRatioFallDuration gradually update their price to reflect changes in the ratio between collateral and borrows in the underlying pool. However, if _collateralRatioFallDuration is low, then the collateral ratio can be quickly and easily manipulated to unfairly liquidate users.

## Vulnerability Detail

Lets say a user borrows from the Pool and isn't liquidatable.

An attacker can manipulate _lastCollateralRatioMantissa, by depositing a large amount of collateral and borrowing a large ratio of that collateral. This will push the collateral Ratio for all loans lower, which will push the innocent user's position into the liquidation threshold.

## Impact

Users can lose funds from being unfairly liquidated when _collateralRatioFallDuration is low.
