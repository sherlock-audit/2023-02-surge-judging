# Collateral ratio and uitlization can be manipulated

## Summary

Collateral ratio and uitlization can be manipulated.

## Vulnerability Detail

The utilization is calculated as follows:

```solidity
         // 4. Calculate the supplied value
        uint _supplied = _totalDebt + _loanTokenBalance;
        // 5. Calculate the utilization
        uint _util = getUtilizationMantissa(_totalDebt, _supplied);
```

With `_loanTokenBalance` being derived as follows:

```solidity
uint _loanTokenBalance = LOAN_TOKEN.balanceOf(address(this));
```

The utuilization is also used in the calculation of the collateral ratio:

```solidity
        _currentCollateralRatioMantissa = getCollateralRatioMantissa(
            _util,
            _lastAccrueInterestTime,
            block.timestamp,
            _lastCollateralRatioMantissa,
            COLLATERAL_RATIO_FALL_DURATION,
            COLLATERAL_RATIO_RECOVERY_DURATION,
            MAX_COLLATERAL_RATIO_MANTISSA,
            SURGE_MANTISSA
        );
```

The protocol design does not account for the case when `_loanTokenBalance` is increased by sending loan tokens directly to the pool without going through the deposit function.

This could be done by an attacker or by someone mistakenly sending loan tokens to the contract. The utilizaion and collateral ratio depend on the accuracy of `_loanTokenBalance`. 

Various functionality of the protocol can be broken either maliciously or by mistake. 
For instance `removeCollateral()` relies on the collateral ratio to determine if a collateral can be removed:

```solidity
require(userCollateralRatioMantissa <= _currentCollateralRatioMantissa, "Pool: user collateral ratio too high");
```

In this case a malicious attacker could prevent the collateral removal by sending loan tokens to the contract and lowering the collateral ratio making the function revert.

## Impact

Break protocol functionality that relies on `_loanTokenBalance`

## Recommendation

Track the loan token balance using a dedicated variable rather than relying on pool balance.
