# Did Not Approve To Zero First

## Summary
medium
 Did Not Approve To Zero First
Allowance was not set to zero first before changing the allowance.

## Vulnerability Detail
Some ERC20 tokens (like USDT) do not work when changing the allowance from an existing non-zero allowance value. For example Tether (USDT)'s approve() function will revert if the current approval is not zero, to protect against front-running changes of approvals.

## Impact
So the call to approve() function without setting the allowance to zero first will fail and protocol will not work for ERC20 tokens like USDT but as mentioned in docs protocol supports all tokens except non-rebasing.
