# Duplicates of pools with same configuration parameters potential to liquidity manipulation

## Summary

Duplicates of pools with same configuration parameters will make dynamic collateral ratio is not expected due to lenders will move their liquidity to the heathy pool with same configuration, abandon the previous pool, thus liquidate the borrower faster than ever on the old pool.

## Vulnerability Detail

According to the [article](https://medium.com/surge-fi/introduction-to-surge-protocol-overview-34cc828d7c50): 
> There may exist multiple pools for the same loan/collateral pair. Pools will likely be adopted more than others based on the optimal combination of risk parameters for both lenders and borrowers and the available amount of liquidity within each pool.

So, by design, anyone can create same loan/collateral pair, and currently the factory **doesn't prohibit any surge pool created with same configuration parameters** and this might raise some disadvantage of what Surge is trying to solve.

A case when a whale for example provide a liquidity to a surge pool, with a loan/collateral pair with an interesting and attractive configuration parameter for the pool. Borrowers will came, and the whale will gradually pull their liquidity, leaving the borrower to liquidatable state, then move their liquidity to the 'fresh' same pair & parameter pool with but the utilization rate of the pool still below the surge threshold (as it's a brand new pool)

Creating the same loan/collateral pair is acceptable, but if the parameter can be the same, the only difference is the liquidity, which can easily be manipulated by some actors with large liquidity to be played around.

Thus protecting the Surge to create a same pair with same parameter I believe is necessary to make it healthy protocol. Furthermore, having pools with same loan/collateral pair and same parameter can introduce far more liquidity fragmentation with it should be just one pool as the pool itself is permissionless, not being controlled by anyone.

## Impact

Lender can move their liquidity and make borrower liquidated faster (from the old pool), and move their liquidity to new fresh and healthy pool with same pair & configuration as the old pool.

## Recommendation

Prohibit the creation of pool with the same loan/collateral pair AND same configuration parameters.
