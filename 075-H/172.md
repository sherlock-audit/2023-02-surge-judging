# Fees can be wrongly calculated

## Summary

For any method like `deposit`, `withdraw` etc, `getCurrentState` is called to get the current state of the Pool. It 

## Vulnerability Detail

While doing any transaction in Pool, all methods uses `getCurrentState` call to get the Updated state. 

`getCurrentState` uses `_feeMantissa` as a argument. The issue here is:

1. Let's say `_feeMantissa` is set to some `x` value initially.
2. The last Update was calculated at time `t` with value `x`.
3. If there is no transaction for some `dt` time and just before the next transaction, operator updated the fees to `x + y`.
4. Now the update will use `x + y` as fees for throughout that duration from `t` to `t + dt` while it should have been only `x` for majority of that duration.

## Impact

Fees can be wrongly calculated.

## Recommendation

Whenever there is a chance in fees, there should a system in place to call `getCurrentState` and update all the state variables till then.
