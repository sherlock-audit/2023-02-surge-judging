# Pool.borrow calculates _newUtil rartio incorrectly and can wrongly restrict user from borrowing

## Summary
Pool.borrow calculates _newUtil rartio incorrectly and can wrongly restrict user from borrowing
## Vulnerability Detail
When user borrows, then [pool utilization is calculated](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-surge/blob/main/surge-protocol-v1/src/Pool.sol#L477) in order to check that it is not bigger than `SURGE_MANTISSA`.

It is calculated like this: 
`getUtilizationMantissa(_currentTotalDebt + amount, (_currentTotalDebt + _loanTokenBalance))`

But the problem is that second argument should also be increased by `amount`, so correct formula will be:
`getUtilizationMantissa(_currentTotalDebt + amount, (_currentTotalDebt + amount + _loanTokenBalance))`

Currently, utilization rate will be always bigger, than it is in real as total assets amount is less. Because of that function can wrongly restrict user from borrowing.
## Impact
function can wrongly restrict user from borrowing.

## Recommendation
Calculate utilization like this:
`getUtilizationMantissa(_currentTotalDebt + amount, (_currentTotalDebt + amount + _loanTokenBalance))`
