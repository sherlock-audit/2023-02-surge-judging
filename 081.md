# Missing events for updates in Factory and a time lock for updating fees

## Summary
Currently the `Factory` is not emitting an event for updating fees and the operator. The fees set in the Factory are globally active for all Pools and take immediate effect after updating. Most of the offchain analysis depend on events to implement notifications for malicious behaviour.
With this in mind a malicious operator can immediatly change the global fees from 0 to 20%. 
Now every interaction with the pool on `deposit` `withdraw` `removeCollateral` `borrow` and `repay` will increas the `balanceOf[_feeRecipient]` what the `_feeRecipient` now can use to withdraw `LOAN_TOKEN`s from the pool and as there was no event and it was immediatly updated the users have no chance to react to it and it will not be recogniced immeditly.

## Vulnerability Detail
A malicious operator can secretly (missing events and a time lock) update the `feeRecipient` and `feeMantissa` value that immediatly come into effect for all Pools. As there is only a check for not >20% he can change the fee directly from 0 to 20%.
This will take immeditly effect and now any call to `deposit` `withdraw` `removeCollateral` `borrow` or `repay` will increase the value the feeRecipient can withdraw from the pool.
If the Pool is very active and with a valuable Token as `LOAN_TOKEN` it can be very profitable for the attacker, until the updated information get recognized by everyone.

## Impact
Updating the `_feeMantissa` value influnces immediatly all Pools and so it needs special care when updating this value. Especially if for example an immediate bigger jump from 0% to 20% happens.

`feeRecipient` update without an event

`feeMantissa` update without an event **and also possible to update immediatly and influnce all Pools deployed with the new fee**

`pendingOperator` update without an event

`operator` + `pendingOperator` update without an event

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add events for updating `feeRecipient` `feeMantissa` `pendingOperator` and `operator` like

```solidity
event FeeRecipientTransferred(address indexed previousFeeRecipient, address newFeeRecipient);
event FeeMantissaUpdated(uint256 previousFee, uint256 newFee);

event OperatorTransferStarted(address indexed previousOperator, address indexed newOperator);
event OperatorTransferred(address indexed previousOperator, address newOperator);
```

Also consider adding a time lock before the `feeMantissa` can be updated to give users the possibility to react to the change.
As the fees are globally valid there should be a protection in place, so it's not possible to change it from 0 to 20 immediatly.
