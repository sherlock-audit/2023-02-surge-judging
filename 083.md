# wrong collateralBalanceOf for "fee-on-transfer" tokens

## Summary
There are several ERC20 tokens that take a small fee on transfers/transferFroms (known as "fee-on-transfer" tokens).
Most notably, USDT is an ERC20 token that has togglable transfer fees, but for now the fee is set to 0. (see the contract here: https://etherscan.io/address/0xdAC17F958D2ee523a2206206994597C13D831ec7#code).
For these tokens, it should not be assumed that if you transfer x tokens to an address, that the address actually receives x tokens.

## Vulnerability Detail
In function [Pool.addCollateral](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-surge/blob/main/surge-protocol-v1/src/Pool.sol#L394-L398), __collateralBalanceOf__ is added based on __amount__, however, there are some __fee-on-transfer__ ERC20 tokens, in such case the amount of tokens __to__ receives is less than __amount__

## Impact
Pools using USDT as collateral will not work properly

## Code Snippet

Manual Review

## Recommendation
collateralBalanceOf[to] += amount_after_transfer - amount_before_transfer
