# Grieving attack by transferring `LOAN_TOKEN` directly to the contract for newly created Pool

## Summary

Newly Created Pool Injected by `LOAN_TOKEN` with amount > 0 will break the pool

## Vulnerability Detail

If someone create a Pool, and a malicious user front-runed, send directly to the pool any amount  (> 0) of `LOAN_TOKEN`, will break the deposit because `_shares` will be 0 thus revert on `require(_shares > 0, "Pool: 0 shares");`

```solidity
File: Pool.sol
199:     function tokenToShares (uint _tokenAmount, uint _supplied, uint _sharesTotalSupply, bool roundUpCheck) internal pure returns (uint) {
200:         if(_supplied == 0) return _tokenAmount;
201:         uint shares = _tokenAmount * _sharesTotalSupply / _supplied;
202:         if(roundUpCheck && shares * _supplied < _tokenAmount * _sharesTotalSupply) shares++;
203:         return shares;
204:     }
...
305:     /// @notice Deposit loan tokens in exchange for pool tokens
306:     /// @param amount The amount of loan tokens to deposit
307:     function deposit(uint amount) external {
308:         uint _loanTokenBalance = LOAN_TOKEN.balanceOf(address(this));
...
324:         uint _shares = tokenToShares(amount, (_currentTotalDebt + _loanTokenBalance), _currentTotalSupply, false);
325:         require(_shares > 0, "Pool: 0 shares");
...
343:     }
```

Scenario:
1. Alice create a new Surge pool with USDC as `LOAN_TOKEN`
2. Bob noticed the creation of new pool made by Alice, and transfer USDC directly to Pool (via token transfer(), not via pool's deposit()) for example 1 wei
3. When Alice trying to `deposit()`, the contract will call `tokenToShares()` with parameter `amount` as being inputted by Alice, `_loanTokenBalance` is 1 wei (from Bob), `_currentTotalDebt` is 0 (for first deposit), and `_currentTotalSupply` will be 0 (first deposit). 
4. Alice deposit will be reverted because the `tokenToShares` will return 0, because `supplied` value (_currentTotalDebt + _loanTokenBalance) is not 0 (it's 1 wei from Bob), thus the `uint shares = _tokenAmount * _sharesTotalSupply / _supplied;` will return 0 (because `_sharesTotalSupply` is 0).

## Impact

Pool will be DOSed, any deposit will failed due to `_shares` will always 0.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Check if LOAN token balance is not 0, and share total supply is not 0

```solidity
 if(_supplied == 0 && _sharesTotalSupply == 0) return _tokenAmount;
```
