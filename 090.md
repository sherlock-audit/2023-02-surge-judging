# Pool shares can be sent to the zero address as fees

## Summary

If the operator sets the fee recipient to the zero address with a non-zero fee mantissa, almost every external function across every pool will revert when called. 

## Vulnerability Detail

In `Factory.sol` the operator role has the ability to change the `feeMantissa` and the `feeRecipient`. While there there is a check to prevent the `feeMantissa` from being set to a non-zero amount while the `feeRecipient` is `address(0)`, there is no similar check to prevent the `feeRecipient` from being changed _to_ `address(0)` when a non-zero `feeMantissa` is already stored in contract state.
```solidity
    function setFeeRecipient(address _feeRecipient) external {
        require(msg.sender == operator, "Factory: not operator");
        feeRecipient = _feeRecipient;
    }
```
This creates the possibility for `getFee` to return the zero-address as the recipient with a non-zero fee mantissa.
```solidity
    function getFee() external view returns (address, uint256) {
        uint256 _feeMantissa = feeMantissa;
        if (_feeMantissa == 0) return (address(0), 0);
        return (feeRecipient, _feeMantissa);
    }
```

## Impact

If a pool has a non-zero amount of debt issued, nearly every external function will call `getFee` and assign shares to the address provided.
```solidity
        (address _feeRecipient, uint256 _feeMantissa) = FACTORY.getFee();
```
```solidity
        if (_accruedFeeShares > 0) {
            balanceOf[_feeRecipient] += _accruedFeeShares;
            emit Transfer(address(0), _feeRecipient, _accruedFeeShares);
        }
```
Considering that there are zero address checks on `transfer` and in `setFeeMantissa`, I assume this is unwanted behavior.

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add logic to `setFeeRecipient` that sets the `feeMantissa` to zero if the zero address is provided as the new `feeRecipient`.

```diff
    function setFeeRecipient(address _feeRecipient) external {
        require(msg.sender == operator, "Factory: not operator");
+       if (_feeRecipient == address(0)) feeMantissa = 0;
        feeRecipient = _feeRecipient;
    }
```
