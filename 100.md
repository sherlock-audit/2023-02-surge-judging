# Potential DoS when a user calls liquidate with the total debt as the amount

## Summary

If a user calls `liquidate` and passes the total debt as the amount instead of type(uint256).max, an attacker can front-run the transaction, calling `liquidate` with the smallest possible amount, making the users call revert.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the `liquidate` function, if a non-type(uint256).max value is passed in as the amount, it is converted to shares and then deducted from the borrower's debt shares balance.
```solidity
            _shares = tokenToShares(_amount, _currentTotalDebt, _debtSharesSupply, false);
```
```solidity
        debtSharesBalanceOf[_borrower] -= _shares;
```
Therefore, if a user attempts to liquidate debt by passing in the total debt balance and an attacker quickly front-runs with a call to `liquidate` with an amount of `1`, the users debt shares balance will underflow when their transaction is executed.

## Impact

This can potentially create a DoS for users that attempt to liquidate full debts. While I realize there is additional functionality that allows a caller to pass in type(uint256).max as the amount to always specify their full debt shares balance, it can easily be missed.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Update logic to check if the amount passed into `liquidate` is larger than the borrower's debt share balance and adjust the amount to prevent underflow.
```diff
-   if (_amount == type(uint256).max || _amount == userDebt) {
+   if (_amount >= userDebt) {
        collateralReward = collateralBalance;
        _shares = debtSharesBalanceOf[_borrower];
        _amount = userDebt;
    } else {
        uint256 userInvertedCollateralRatioMantissa = collateralBalance * 1e18 / userDebt;
        collateralReward = _amount * userInvertedCollateralRatioMantissa / 1e18; // rounds down
        _shares = tokenToShares(_amount, _currentTotalDebt, _debtSharesSupply, false);
    }
```
