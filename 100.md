# Potential reentrancy in Pool.withdraw

## Summary

The withdraw function allows users to withdraw funds from the contract, but it does not properly manage state changes before making an external call to transfer the funds. 

## Vulnerability Detail

The withdraw function allows users to withdraw funds from the contract, but it does not properly manage state changes before making an external call to transfer the funds. 

## Impact

This could allow an attacker to exploit a reentrancy vulnerability and repeatedly withdraw funds before the previous call has been completed.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Use a simple reentrancy guard, such as [OpenZeppelinâ€™s ReentrancyGuard](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/utils/ReentrancyGuard.sol) to prevent reentrancy in MetaSwap.swap(). It might seem more obvious to put this check in Spender.swap(), but the Spender contract intentionally does not use any storage to avoid interference between different adapters.
