# `feeRecipient` can be set to address(0) even if `feeMantissa` is more than zero

## Summary

 The protocol have a single `operator` role that can only set the `feeMantissa` (up to 20% fee) and the `feeRecipient` address, But as we can see on the bellow code:

```solidity
    function setFeeMantissa(uint _feeMantissa) external {
        require(msg.sender == operator, "Factory: not operator");
        require(_feeMantissa <= MAX_FEE_MANTISSA, "Factory: fee too high");
        if(_feeMantissa > 0) require(feeRecipient != address(0), "Factory: fee recipient is zero address");
        feeMantissa = _feeMantissa;
    }
```
The protocol added a check on the line [63](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-surge/blob/main/surge-protocol-v1/src/Factory.sol#L63) to prevent the `operator` from setting the `feeRecipient` to address(0) when the `_feeMantissa` is more than 0.

## Vulnerability Detail

The `operator` can bypass this check easily with the following steps: 

- The `operator` set the `feeRecipient` to a valid address.
- The `operator` set the `feeMantissa` to the max value (0.2e18).
- Now the `operator` can easily set `feeRecipient` to address(0) and cause a lose of fund to the protocol.

## Impact

Possible loss of fund when the `feeRecipient` is address(0).

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add the next check to the `setFeeRecipient()` :

```solidity
    function setFeeRecipient(address _feeRecipient) external {
        require(msg.sender == operator, "Factory: not operator");
        if(feeMantissa > 0) require(_feeRecipient!= address(0), "Factory: fee recipient is zero address");
        feeRecipient = _feeRecipient;
    }
```
