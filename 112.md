# Deposits can be fully sandwich attacked, leading to loss of funds for attacked users

## Summary

The `deposit` function lacks safety in case of a sandwich attack. This results in users paying more for less in cases when they are sandwiched.

## Vulnerability Detail

Function `deposit` from `Pool.sol` does not have any sandwich attack safety. It accepts only the `amount` to deposit
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-surge/blob/main/surge-protocol-v1/src/Pool.sol#L307
```Solidity
function deposit(uint amount) external
```
Users deposit `amount` of loan tokens but do not know how much shares they should receive based on the system's state. 

Shares are calculated in `tokenToShares`:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-surge/blob/main/surge-protocol-v1/src/Pool.sol#L201
```Solidity
        uint shares = _tokenAmount * _sharesTotalSupply / _supplied;
```
where `_supplied`, when depositing is the `_currentTotalDebt + _loanTokenBalance` where `_loanTokenBalance` increases on each deposit.

As such, when a classical sandwich attack:
- `alice` wants to deposit X amount of loan tokens, expecting to receive Y shares
- `bob` sees this transaction in the mempool and launches a sandwich attack
- `bob` deposits first, thus increasing the amount of loan tokens and decreases the shares value Y that `alice` was entitled to
- `alice` finishes depositing and has no way to realize she overpaid
- `bob` withdraws his shares, with a profit from the sandwiched `alice`

## Impact

Loss of funds for users; Overpay for pool shares.

## Code Snippet

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

First the user needs to be able to determine how much shares he should be entitled to. So a public function `tokenToShares` should be made. Rename the old `tokenToShares` to `_tokenToShares` as it's internal and make the public version calculate the the shares that would be returned.

Add a parameter to `deposit` that represents the minimum amount of shares to be accepted. If this argument is 0, ignore it.
This way, users can, before depositing, have an idea of how much they are expecting and cam put a tolerance level of how much they are willing to not receive (slipage basically)
Example:
```Solidity

    function tokenToShares(uint amount) internal view returns (uint) {
        uint _loanTokenBalance = LOAN_TOKEN.balanceOf(address(this));
        (, uint _feeMantissa) = FACTORY.getFee();
        (  
            uint _currentTotalSupply, , , uint _currentTotalDebt
        ) = getCurrentState(
            _loanTokenBalance,
            _feeMantissa,
            lastCollateralRatioMantissa,
            totalSupply,
            lastAccrueInterestTime,
            lastTotalDebt
        );
        return _tokenToShares(amount, (_currentTotalDebt + _loanTokenBalance), _currentTotalSupply, false);
    }

    /// @notice Deposit loan tokens in exchange for pool tokens
    /// @param amount The amount of loan tokens to deposit
    function deposit(uint amount, uint minAmountOut) external {
        uint _loanTokenBalance = LOAN_TOKEN.balanceOf(address(this));
        (address _feeRecipient, uint _feeMantissa) = FACTORY.getFee();
        (  
            uint _currentTotalSupply,
            uint _accruedFeeShares,
            uint _currentCollateralRatioMantissa,
            uint _currentTotalDebt
        ) = getCurrentState(
            _loanTokenBalance,
            _feeMantissa,
            lastCollateralRatioMantissa,
            totalSupply,
            lastAccrueInterestTime,
            lastTotalDebt
        );

        uint _shares = _tokenToShares(amount, (_currentTotalDebt + _loanTokenBalance), _currentTotalSupply, false);
        
        if (minAmountOut != 0)  require(_shares >= minAmountOut);

        // the rest of the code
