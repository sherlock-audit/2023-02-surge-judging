# A user can manipulate Loantoken balance to manipulate shares in a grieving attack

## Summary
The function the tokentoshares issues and withdraws shares to users whenever they call deposit or withdraw. However, a malicious user can directly deposit loan tokens into the pool contract and manipulate tokentoshares so that users will earn less shares than anticipated. This can be used in a grieving attack to cause users to earn less shares than they anticipated.


## Vulnerability Detail
The function tokentoshares is used frequently throughout the protocol. It calculates the amount of shares to issue or withdraw based on the token amount. For example it is used here in the deposit function 

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-surge/blob/main/surge-protocol-v1/src/Pool.sol#L370

It is calculated by the formula stated here 
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-surge/blob/main/surge-protocol-v1/src/Pool.sol#L201

When _supplied increases, tokentoshares become smaller. 

upon closer inspection, _supplied is calculated as follows 

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-surge/blob/main/surge-protocol-v1/src/Pool.sol#L132

Investigating further we see that the variable  _loanTokenBalance is calculated as follows 

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-surge/blob/main/surge-protocol-v1/src/Pool.sol#L308

So a malicious user with loan tokens can directly send them to the pool contract without triggering tokentoshares. Therefore, when another user tries to call deposit after a direct deposit of token, the user will receive less shares than what he or she anticipated because tokentoshares was maliciously reduced.



## Impact
Several functions will be compromised including deposit, withdraw, and repay.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
One suggestion would be to use a mapping instead of the loan token balance of the address to track loantoken balances
