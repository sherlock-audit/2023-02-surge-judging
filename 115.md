# An Attack Vector on the Approve/TransferFrom Methods

## Summary

With a given party that has accepted that another party can transfer N tokens, because the way the approve system is implemented, if the original party reconsiders and wants to reduce the allowed amount to a new, less value, then that transaction can be attacked and the original party actually lose the original amount and the new amount.

## Vulnerability Detail

This is a classical attack that can happen if a protocol is using `approve` for simple approvals. This results in potentially more tokens being used by a 3rd party then intended.

This applies to the current `transferFrom`, `transfer` and `approve` functions;

    function transferFrom(address from, address to, uint amount) external returns (bool) {
        require(to != address(0), "Pool: to cannot be address 0");
        allowance[from][msg.sender] -= amount;
        balanceOf[from] -= amount;
        unchecked {
            balanceOf[to] += amount;
        }
        emit Transfer(from, to, amount);
        return true;
    }


    /// @notice Approves an address to spend pool tokens on behalf of the sender
    /// @param spender The address of the spender
    /// @param amount The amount of pool tokens to approve
    /// @return bool that indicates if the operation was successful
    function approve(address spender, uint amount) external returns (bool) {
        allowance[msg.sender][spender] = amount;
        emit Approval(msg.sender, spender, amount);
        return true;
    }
```

A general explanation/flow:
- Alice's attempt to change the Bob's allowance from N to M (N>0 and M>0) made it possible for Bob to transfer N+M of Alice's tokens, while Alice never wanted to allow so many of her tokens to be transferred by Bob.
