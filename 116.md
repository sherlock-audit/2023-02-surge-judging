# [M-3] Approve function is vulnerable to frontrunning attack

## Summary

A user can front run the approval function and steal more pool tokens than they are intended to have.

## Vulnerability Detail

Let's take the example where Alice approves Bob the ability to have an allowance of N tokens. After approving Bob an allowance of N tokens, Alice decides she wants to change N to M. Bob can front run the `approve(M)` transaction by first claiming his N tokens, and then waiting until after `approve(M)` succeeds to take another M tokens. In this scenario Bob has successfully taken N more tokens than Alice intended.

## Impact

A user can steal another user's tokens by frontrunning the allowance approval.

Manual Review 

## Recommendation

There is a two step process that should be followed when implementing a safe approval mechanism. First you should only allow approval to be called when setting the initial allowance or when resetting the allowance to 0. Secondly, there should be two separate allowance functions for increasing and decreasing the allowance. Refer to OpenZeppelin's Safe Approval implementation below.

```solidity
function safeApprove(IERC20 token, address spender, uint256 value) internal {
        // safeApprove should only be called when setting an initial allowance,
        // or when resetting it to zero. To increase and decrease it, use
        // 'safeIncreaseAllowance' and 'safeDecreaseAllowance'
        require(
            (value == 0) || (token.allowance(address(this), spender) == 0),
            "SafeERC20: approve from non-zero to non-zero allowance"
        );
        _callOptionalReturn(token, abi.encodeWithSelector(token.approve.selector, spender, value));
    }

    /**
     * @dev Increase the calling contract's allowance toward `spender` by `value`. If `token` returns no value,
     * non-reverting calls are assumed to be successful.
     */
    function safeIncreaseAllowance(IERC20 token, address spender, uint256 value) internal {
        uint256 oldAllowance = token.allowance(address(this), spender);
        _callOptionalReturn(token, abi.encodeWithSelector(token.approve.selector, spender, oldAllowance + value));
    }

    /**
     * @dev Decrease the calling contract's allowance toward `spender` by `value`. If `token` returns no value,
     * non-reverting calls are assumed to be successful.
     */
    function safeDecreaseAllowance(IERC20 token, address spender, uint256 value) internal {
        unchecked {
            uint256 oldAllowance = token.allowance(address(this), spender);
            require(oldAllowance >= value, "SafeERC20: decreased allowance below zero");
            _callOptionalReturn(token, abi.encodeWithSelector(token.approve.selector, spender, oldAllowance - value));
        }
    }

```
