# Fee Theft of Fake Pools

## Summary

The Factory has a mapping `isPool` that can be used to verify a pool was officially set up through the Factory. Although there is verification in the Factory there is no verification in the Pool contract that the caller is the official Factory. This allows a malicious user to fake a pool and bypass the `MAX_FEE_MANTISSA` resulting in a theft of funds.

## Vulnerability Detail

The pool contract is initialized with the `msg.sender` contract with no checks on if it is the official Factory. This allows anyone to create non-official pools through their own Factory contract.

```Solidity
FACTORY = IFactory(msg.sender);
```

**Example Attack**

Alice is a malicious user who deploys a pool and manages to convince others to join her pool. Alice tells the victims to check the source if they have doubts and the source will match `pool.sol`.

In Alice's Factory contract:
1. The constructor creates a pool.
2. A `getFee` method exists like below with `_feeMantissa` = 1.0e18 (> `MAX_FEE_MANTISSA` = 0.2e18):

```Solidity
function getFee() external view returns (address, uint) {
	return (address(this), 1.0e18);
}
```

3. A `withdraw` function exists which calls the pool `withdraw` function allowing her to withdraw stolen funds from her shares.

## Impact

Alice is able to unreasonably inflate her shares through fees, and as a result take user funds.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Require the msg.sender to be the official Factory address in the Pool constructor.
