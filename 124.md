# A malicious actor can liquidate users prematurely to claim their collateral tokens.

## Summary
A malicious actor can use the loan tokens he stole from the Pool to liquidate users prematurely and make away with their collateral tokens.

## Vulnerability Detail
There is no access control implementation in the liquidate() function which is bad, anyone can liquidate users if they can pay the loan tokens.

## Impact
take this scenario for example.

**A malicious actor Praise using a malicious contract does the following:** 

i.) inputs 'type(uint).max' as amount in the withdraw() function,  withdraws all loan tokens in the pool as there is no check to make sure users can **only** withdraw their **own loan tokens** which should be **directly proportional** to their deposit. 

ii.) Now praise uses all the loan tokens he just exploited from the pool **to liquidate every borrower** prematurely to do away with their collateral tokens. E.g let's say there are 50 borrowers. With the vast amount of loan tokens praise exploited from the pool he should be able to use it to liquidate all 50 borrowers prematurely, thereby claiming all their collateral tokens. He does this in turns.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Access control should be implemented. There should be Liquidators who their only role is to Liquidate users when the conditions for liquidation are met.
Everyone should not be able to liquidate.

Also i believe if the vulnerability in the withdraw() function is taken care of, that should also take care of this one in some way.
