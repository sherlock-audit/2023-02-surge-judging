# Attackers may skip the collateral ratio recovery duration to inflate collateralization ratios and steal funds

## Summary

Under certain market conditions, attackers can bypass the collateralization ratio update system to instantly send the collateralization ratio from zero to maximum.

The collateralization ratio in Surge defines the amount of loan token that can be borrowed per wei of collateral token. In this way it acts as both a collateralization ratio as in other lending markets but also as an exchange rate, as the ratio is taken directly between the two tokens instead of through an intermediary such as dollars.

A Surge pool linearly decreaes the collateralization ratio to zero when it is in "Surge mode", in order to reduce demand. When the pool is not in "Surge mode", it increases the collateralization ratio similarly up to the preset maximum. However, an attacker can use a quirk in the way the utilization is calculated to instantly send a pool from zero to the maximum, greatly manipulating the exchange rate.

## Vulnerability Detail

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-surge/blob/main/surge-protocol-v1/src/Pool.sol#L216-L263

The collateralization ratio is calculated as either 

`_lastCollateralRatioMantissa + timeDelta * _maxCollateralRatioMantissa / _collateralRatioRecoveryDuration`
or 
`_lastCollateralRatioMantissa - timeDelta * _maxCollateralRatioMantissa / _collateralRatioFallDuration `

Depending on whether the contract is not, or is, in Surge mode (respectively).

Consider a pool that has been in a state that is just under Surge mode for a long time. That is `_util <= _surgeMantissa` but the two values are very close together. There have not been any interactions with the pool in a while so `timeDelta` is large. This means that the next interaction with the pool will use a collateralization ratio of 0.

An attacker can bypass this by gifting a small amount of the loan token to the contract. This will cause the utilization (`_util`) to go up on the next calculation.

Now even though the contract has not been in surge mode, on the next interaction it will think that it has been and the large `timeDelta` will be applied to a collateralization ratio increase instead of a collateralization ratio decrease.

The attacker can take advantage of the maximum collateralization ratio to borrow funds at an inflated valuation, stealing assets from the pool because they were able to skip the `_collateralRatioRecoveryDuration`.

## Impact

Loss of funds from pool depositors.

## Recommendation

When calculating utilization, only use the most recently cached values of token balances instead of using live values.
