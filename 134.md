# Saving 800 Gas in Pool.sol contract's repay function

## Summary

The code in the repay function of Pool.sol contract can be optimized to save 800 gas by using a local variable to store debtSharesBalanceOf[borrower].

## Vulnerability Detail

In the current code, a SLOAD operation is performed to retrieve the debtSharesBalanceOf[borrower] value every time the borrower wants to repay all their debt. This SLOAD operation can be saved by copying the value to a local variable.

## Impact

The impact of this bug is medium. However, it saves 800 gas every time the borrower repays all their debt.

## Code Snippet

[Github link to code](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-surge/blob/main/surge-protocol-v1/src/Pool.sol#L524-L527)

```solidity
       if(amount == type(uint).max) {
            amount = getDebtOf(debtSharesBalanceOf[borrower], _debtSharesSupply, _currentTotalDebt);
            _shares = debtSharesBalanceOf[borrower]; // This SLOAD can be saved. 
        } else {
            _shares = tokenToShares(amount, _currentTotalDebt, _debtSharesSupply, false);
        }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

The code can be modified as follows to optimize the SLOAD operation:

```solidity
       if(amount == type(uint).max) {
            uint256    _borrowerDebtSharesBalance = debtSharesBalanceOf[borrower]; // Get a local reference.
            amount = getDebtOf(_borrowerDebtSharesBalance, _debtSharesSupply, _currentTotalDebt);
            _shares = _borrowerDebtSharesBalance;
        } else {
            _shares = tokenToShares(amount, _currentTotalDebt, _debtSharesSupply, false);
        }
```
