# H- 1 wei ERC4626

## Summary

`Pool.sol` have similar **token to share** structure as ERC4626 and have the same exploit as ERC4626. ([Link](https://github.com/transmissions11/solmate/issues/178))

## Vulnerability Detail

Both pool share `balanceOf` and pool debt `debtShare` record can be manipulated by first user interact with pool directly.

Transfer 1 wei of `LoanToken` into any pool before first deposit will increase `_loanTokenBalance` or `_supplied` to value != 0. This allow skip zero check in `tokenToShares()` function.

This make function relied on `tokenToShares()` susceptible to manipulation like [`deposit` function  always revert](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-surge/blob/main/surge-protocol-v1/src/Pool.sol#L324).

[It happen because `_supplied != 0` which skip first null if check and because `_sharesTotalSupply == 0`. `tokenToShares` will always return 0 in this case.](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-surge/blob/main/surge-protocol-v1/src/Pool.sol#L199-L204)

Beside transfer 1 wei, any meaningful attack can inflated `tokenToShares()` or `getDebtOf()` price to really high value like 1e18 token for 1 wei share. Which allow `tokenToShares()` floating point rounding error to make user loss portion of their fund and benefit user with more share like first depositor. ([Further detail](https://github.com/transmissions11/solmate/issues/178))

## Impact

Attacker can DOS any new pool with 1 wei token deposit. With L2 implementation, this make it quite easy,cheap to attack.

Any actual meaningful attack can inflated pool share to benefit pool creator or first depositor and chipping away portion of fund from other user.

Debt Share also used the same mechanic, this allow 1 debtor with inflated debt price to hold most debt share without repay in full.

## Tool used

Forge Test
```js
    function testDeposit1Wei() external {        
        MockERC20 collateralToken = new MockERC20(100e18, 18);
        MockERC20 loanToken = new MockERC20(100e18, 18);
        Pool pool = factory.deploySurgePool(IERC20(address(collateralToken)), IERC20(address(loanToken)), 1e18, 0.8e18, 1e15, 1e15, 0.1e18, 0.4e18, 0.6e18);
        loanToken.approve(address(pool), 10e18);
        emit log_named_uint("pool.balanceOf(address(this))", pool.balanceOf(address(this)));
        //transfer 1 wei loantoken to pool
        loanToken.transfer(address(pool), 1);
        //deposit share. Reverted
        pool.deposit(5e18);
        emit log_named_uint("pool.balanceOf(address(this))", pool.balanceOf(address(this)));
        emit log_named_uint("loanToken.balanceOf(address(pool))", loanToken.balanceOf(address(pool)));
        //expect share > 1
        assertLt(pool.balanceOf(address(this)), 1e1);
    }
```

## Recommendation

Not recommending to cache `_loanTokenBalance` based on amount of user deposit or repay as it complex project way more.

Since project have already give user sufficient warning on the frontend, it might just enough to make sure all new pool from `factory.sol` must included first deposit.
While the case of pool without share or share really small is possible. It is much simpler to just decomission pool when users withdraw all funds or `LoanToken` reach really small value.
