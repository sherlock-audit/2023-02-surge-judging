# Tokens with high decimals can break the protocol

## Summary

Tokens with high decimals can break the protocol

## Vulnerability Detail

The protocol does not take into account that pools can be created with tokens that have very high decimals.

There are various calculations that would likely revert to overflow in some scenarios. 
For instance when calculating values such as utilization where the `_totalDebt` is first multiplied by `1e18`

```solidity
    function getUtilizationMantissa(uint _totalDebt, uint _supplied) internal pure returns (uint) {
        if(_supplied == 0) return 0;
        return _totalDebt * 1e18 / _supplied;
    }
```
When repaying a loan, the `_currentTotalDebt` is used in the calculation of shares to be deducted from their balance. 

```solidity
_shares = tokenToShares(amount, _currentTotalDebt, _debtSharesSupply, false);
```

## Impact

Breaking protocol functionality.

## Recommendation

Scale tokens to a specified scale that can be used in the pools.
