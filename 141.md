# Front-runnable `approve()`

## Summary
The function logic of `approve()` in Pool.sol can be front-run by the spender to exploit on double spending of the allowances granted by the owner.  

## Vulnerability Detail
Here is the typical exploit scenario:

1. Alice call `approve()` to approve Bob to spend 100 shares of pool tokens on her behalf.
2. She then changes her mind wanting to decrease Bob's allowance from 100 shares to 50 shares.
3. Bob, upon seeing this on the mempool, proceeds to front-run Alice's transaction by calling `transferFrom()` to transfer 100 shares of pool tokens to a designated address.
4. When Alice's transaction is executed, Bob gets another 50 shares of allowance to transfer 50 shares of pool tokens to another or the same designated address.

## Impact
Bob ends up transferring 150 (instead of 100 or 50) shares of pool tokens to whoever he chooses.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
    function approve(address spender, uint amount) external returns (bool) {
        allowance[msg.sender][spender] = amount;
        emit Approval(msg.sender, spender, amount);
        return true;
    }
```
[File: Pool.sol#L284-L293](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-surge/blob/main/surge-protocol-v1/src/Pool.sol#L284-L293)

```solidity
    function transferFrom(address from, address to, uint amount) external returns (bool) {
        require(to != address(0), "Pool: to cannot be address 0");
        allowance[from][msg.sender] -= amount;
        balanceOf[from] -= amount;
        unchecked {
            balanceOf[to] += amount;
        }
        emit Transfer(from, to, amount);
        return true;
    }
```
## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider having the affected `approve()` refactored as follows:

```diff
-    function approve(address spender, uint amount) external returns (bool) {
+    function approve(address spender, uint amount, bool increase) external returns (bool) {
-        allowance[msg.sender][spender] = amount;
+        if (increase) {
+            allowance[msg.sender][spender] += amount;
+        }
+        else {
+            allowance[msg.sender][spender] -= amount;
+        }
-        emit Approval(msg.sender, spender, amount);
+        emit Approval(msg.sender, spender, allowance[msg.sender][spender]);
        return true;
    }
```
Changing the logic to increase/decrease allowances as recommended above is a standard practice to help mitigate the exploit by checking whether or not the previous approval has been spent. If the previous allowance has been used up, the function will revert to avoid granting the latest allowance. It will avoid double spending of allowances in the exploit scenario described earlier but will not switch it in time for a smaller allowance though.
