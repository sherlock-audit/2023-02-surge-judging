# User can borrow loan token without having enough collateral tokens

## Summary
The value of mantissa (10^18) isn't big enough for some pairs of tokens which have the tremendous difference in value. 
 
## Vulnerability Detail
The collateralRatioMantissa is calculated by dividing the userDebt * 10^18 with collateral balance of the borrower. This calculation can't be applied for some pairs like BTC and SHIB, because this ratio will return the value 0 even the value of collateral is less than the debt value. 

For instance: 
* **LOAN_TOKEN:** BTC 
    * price: 20000$
    * decimals: 10^8
* **COLLATERAL_TOKEN:** SHIB 
    * price: 0.00001$ 
    * decimals: 10^18

Obviously when a user wants to borrow 10^8 BTC, they will need at least `20000 / 0.00001 * 10^18 = 2 * 10^27` SHIB as collateral. But applying this case into the current implementation, the borrowers can borrow 10^8 BTC with less than 2 * 10^27 SHIB. To prove the statement, I will assume that `collateralBalanceOf[borrower] = 10^27 < 2 * 10^27`
The function `Pool.borrow()` is as follows: 
```solidity=
/// url = https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-surge/blob/main/surge-protocol-v1/src/Pool.sol#L455-L498
function borrow(uint amount) external {
    /// ... 
    
    uint userCollateralRatioMantissa = userDebt * 1e18 / collateralBalanceOf[msg.sender];
    require(userCollateralRatioMantissa <= _currentCollateralRatioMantissa, "Pool: user collateral ratio too high");

    /// ... 
}
```
As we can see that the loan is accepted if `userCollateralRatioMantissa <= _currentCollateralRatioMantissa`, in my example: 
* `userDebt = 10^8`
* `collateralBalanceOf[msg.sender] = 10^27`
* `userCollateralRatioMantissa = 10^8 * 10^18 / 10^27 = 0 <= _currentCollateralRatioMantissa`
==> The condition satisfied

Borrower can use 10^27 SHIB (`10000$`) to borrow 10^8 BTC (`20000$`) to make the `10000$` profit 

## Impact
Users can borrow the loan tokens without having enough collateral tokens
