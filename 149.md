# `Factory.sol` is vulnerable for the the reorg attack

## Summary
Function `Factory.deploySurgePool()` is responsible to deploy a new surge pool contract using the opcode `create`, where the address derivation depends only on the Factory's nonce. 

Note that, some chains like Polygon are suspicious of the reorg attack (following the [README](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-surge-WelToHackerLand#on-chain-context), the surge protocol is deployed on Polygon, Arbitrum and other EVM chains).

As we can see that the Polygon has in practice subject to reorgs. Even more, the reorg on the picture is 1.5 minutes long. So, it is quite enough to create the Pool and transfer funds to that address, especially when someone uses a script, and not doing it by hand.
 
## Vulnerability Detail
Imagine that Alice deploys a Pool, and then deposits LOAN_TOKEN to it. Bob sees that the network block reorg happens and calls `Factory.deploySurgePool()`. Thus, it creates a pool with an address to which Alice sends funds. Then Alice 's transactions are executed and Alice transfers funds to Bob's controlled pool. Bob can change the parameter like `COLLATERAL_TOKEN` to make profit from it (he can set `COLLATERAL_TOKEN` by a self-deployed tokens then take a loan with LOAN_TOKEN that Alice deposited into). 

## Impact
Depositors can lose their fund

## Recommendation
Consider to user `create2` with the salt containing `mgs.sender`
