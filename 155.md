# # [H-03] If the value of the collateral token drops, depositors may lose a large portion of their deposits.

## Summary

When the value of collateral token decreases so that the exchange rate is lower than the collateral ratio, there is incentive for borrowers to default their loan, no incentive for any user to liquidate the debt. All users will try to front-run to borrow, all depositors will rush to withdraw their loan tokens. The last depositors to withdraw will lose their deposits.

## Vulnerability Detail

Smart contract security and economic incentives are two key factors for the sustainability of a DEFI lending protocol. However, the protocol does not provide enough economic incentive for borrowers and liquidators to act according to its design.

POC:

- When the value of collateral token rises:
Suppose Alice creates a Surge lending pool of WETH and USDT (a stable coin) and sets `maxCollateralRatioMantissa` at 1000e18 (meaning 1 WETH can be collateralized to borrow 1000 USDT). The market exchange rate at the pool created time is 1500 USDT/WETH, so the price-based collateral ratio is 150% (1500/1000). If the WETH price goes up to 3000 USDT/WETH, borrowers have no incentive to use the pool because the price-based collateral ratio becomes 300% (3000/1000), which is too costly and inefficient. If the WETH price keeps rising and the pool cannot adjust the `maxCollateralRatioMantissa` because it is fixed at creation time, the pool will lose borrowers.

- When the value of collateral token decreases:
Suppose Alice creates a Surge lending pool of WETH and USDT (a stable coin) and sets `maxCollateralRatioMantissa` at 1000e18 (meaning 1 WETH can be collateralized to borrow 1000 USDT). The market exchange rate at the pool created time is 1500 USDT/WETH, so the price-based collateral ratio is 150% (1500/1000).
     If the WETH price drops to 800 USDT/WETH:
        This creates a big incentive for:
            - Borrowers to borrow more USDT for arbitrage and default on their loans.
            - Depositors to withdraw their liquidity to avoid losses.
        There is no incentive for:
            - Liquidators to liquidate the loans (because of incur losses).

The borrowers will try to borrow as much as possible before the depositors withdraw (max utility rate). The depositors will try to withdraw as soon as possible before others do.The borrowers will let their loans be liquidated. And no one will want to liquidate the loans and incur losses (They would have to pay 1500 USDT for a WETH). In this case, the late depositors will lose their assets.


## Impact

The lending pool faces a high risk of insolvency during periods of market stress, and depositors (liquidity providers) may incur substantial losses on their assets.

## Recommendation

The lending pool needs to implement mechanisms that incentivize users economically
- Liquidity penalty: encourages borrowers to keep their collateral ratio safe.
- Liquidity bonus for liquidators: motivates liquidators to claim the collateral.
