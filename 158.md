# Miscounting of collateral balance within the Pool#`addCollateral()`, which results in the the loss of available amount of the loan tokens to be able to borrow for the caller (depositor)

## Title
Miscounting of collateral balance within the Pool#`addCollateral()`, which results in the the loss of available amount of the loan tokens to be able to borrow for the caller (depositor).

## Summary
Within the Pool#`addCollateral()`, the `collateralBalanceOf` is supposed to record the collateral balance of the caller address (`msg.sender`). However, the `collateralBalanceOf records the collateral balance of the `to` that an arbitrary address is assigned as a parameter of the Pool#`addCollateral()`.

This lead to miscounting of collateral balance of caller (depositor) of the Pool#`addCollateral()`. And therefore it results in  the loss of available amount of the loan tokens to be able to borrow for the caller (depositor). 

## Vulnerability Detail
Within the Pool contract, the `collateralBalanceOf` would be defined as a mapping storage like this:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-surge/blob/main/surge-protocol-v1/src/Pool.sol#L45
```solidity
    mapping (address => uint) public collateralBalanceOf;
```

Within the Pool#`addCollateral()`,
an arbitrary address can be assigned into the `to` parameter and it's assigned as an argument value into the `collateralBalanceOf` to record the collateral balance of the `to` address. And then, the `amount` of the collateral tokens would be transferred from the caller (`msg.sender`) to the Pool contract like this:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-surge/blob/main/surge-protocol-v1/src/Pool.sol#L394-L396
```solidity
    /// @notice Deposit collateral tokens
    /// @param to The address to receive the collateral deposit
    /// @param amount The amount of collateral tokens to deposit
    function addCollateral(address to, uint amount) external { /// @audit
        collateralBalanceOf[to] += amount;  /// @audit
        safeTransferFrom(COLLATERAL_TOKEN, msg.sender, address(this), amount);
        emit Secure(to, msg.sender, amount);
    }
```

On the other hand, within the Pool#`addCollateral()` above, the `collateralBalanceOf` is supposed to record the collateral balance of the caller address (`msg.sender`).
However, within the Pool#`addCollateral()` above, the `collateralBalanceOf` records the collateral balance of the `to` address assigned an arbitrary address.

If a caller wrongly assign an other arbitrary address instead of the caller's address (`msg.sender`) itself into the `to` parameter of the Pool#`addCollateral()` by mistake, the collateral balance will be recorded for the arbitrary address that the caller assigned. 
As a result, despite the caller deposited (transferred) the amount of collateral into the Pool via the Pool#`addCollateral()`, the collateral balance of the caller will not be increased. This lead to the loss of available amount of the loan tokens to be able to borrow for the caller.

## Impact
This lead to miscounting of collateral balance of caller (depositor) of the Pool#`addCollateral()`. As a result, despite the caller (depositor) deposits some amount of collateral tokens, the available amount of borrowing of loan tokens will be less than the actual amount that the caller (depositor) can borrow. Thus, this results in the loss of available amount of the loan tokens to be able to borrow for the caller (depositor).

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
 Consider removing the parameter of `to` and assigning the `msg.sender` into the mapping storage of `collateralBalanceOf` instead of the `to` address like this:
```solidity
-   function addCollateral(address to, uint amount) external {
+   function addCollateral(uint amount) external {
-       collateralBalanceOf[to] += amount;
+       collateralBalanceOf[msg.sender] += amount;
        safeTransferFrom(COLLATERAL_TOKEN, msg.sender, address(this), amount);
        emit Secure(to, msg.sender, amount);
    }
```
