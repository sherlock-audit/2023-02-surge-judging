# Uncertainty in interest rates for the borrower and the lender

## Summary
The amount of interest is calculated in a linear manner between any two times that we want to calculate it. So depending on how frequently we calculate the interest amount the borrower has to pay different amount of interest. The borrower and lender will have no idea about the interest amount that they will have to pay or receive. They can only calculate the minimum and maximum possible rate. This will lead to uncertainty in the interest rates for the borrower and the lender.

## Vulnerability Detail
The amount of interest gets calculated and added to the totalDebt each time the `getCurrentState` is called. This is how the interest amount is calculated:

https://github.com/Surge-fi/surge-protocol-v1/blob/b7cb1dc2a2dcb4bf22c765a4222d7520843187c6/src/Pool.sol#L154
```solidity
uint _interest = _totalDebt * _borrowRate * _timeDelta / (365 days * 1e18);
```
Which is a linear calculation. So if we call `getCurrentState` more frequently the interest amount will be more. This will lead to uncertainty in the interest rates for the borrower and the lender.

The most possible interest rate happens if this function gets called on every block and the minimum amount will happen if this function gets called only once when the borrower wants to return the debt. 
So the actual amount of interest that the borrower has to pay will be somewhere between the red and green lines in the graph below.

## Impact
The lender and borrower will have no idea of the exact amount of interest that will be paid or received. This will lead to uncertainty in the interest rates for the borrower and the lender.

## Code Snippet
The following two test cases show the difference in the interest amount that the borrower has to pay if the `getCurrentState` function gets called more frequently. The first one passes since we expect the interest amount to be calculated linearly. The second one fails since the interest amount is more than the expected amount.

First test (linear, passes):
```solidity
function testInterestAccrual() external {
    uint amount = 1e36;
    uint borrowAmount = amount / 2;
    MockERC20 collateralToken = new MockERC20(amount, 18);
    MockERC20 loanToken = new MockERC20(amount * 2, 18);
    Pool pool = factory.deploySurgePool(IERC20(address(collateralToken)), IERC20(address(loanToken)), 1e18, 0.5e18, 1e15, 1e15, 0.1e18, 0.4e18, 0.6e18);
    loanToken.approve(address(pool), type(uint).max);
    collateralToken.approve(address(pool), type(uint).max);
    pool.deposit(amount);
    pool.addCollateral(address(this), borrowAmount);
    pool.borrow(borrowAmount / 2);
    if(borrowAmount == 0) return;
    assertApproxEqAbs(pool.lastTotalDebt(), borrowAmount / 2, 1, "a");
    assertEq(pool.debtSharesBalanceOf(address(this)), pool.lastTotalDebt(), "b");
    pool.borrow(borrowAmount / 2);
    assertApproxEqAbs(pool.lastTotalDebt(), borrowAmount, 1, "c");
    assertEq(pool.debtSharesBalanceOf(address(this)), pool.lastTotalDebt(), "d");

    vm.warp(block.timestamp + 365 days);
    pool.withdraw(0); // accrues interest

    uint debt = pool.lastTotalDebt();
    uint expectedDebt = borrowAmount + (borrowAmount * 0.4e18 * 365 days / (365 days * 1e18));
    assertApproxEqAbs(debt, expectedDebt, 5, "e");
    pool.repay(address(this), debt);
    pool.withdraw(debt);
    pool.removeCollateral(borrowAmount);
}
```
Second test (exponential, fails):

```solidity
function testInterestDifference() external {
    uint amount = 1e36;
    uint borrowAmount = amount / 2;
    MockERC20 collateralToken = new MockERC20(amount, 18);
    MockERC20 loanToken = new MockERC20(amount * 2, 18);
    Pool pool = factory.deploySurgePool(IERC20(address(collateralToken)), IERC20(address(loanToken)), 1e18, 0.5e18, 1e15, 1e15, 0.1e18, 0.4e18, 0.6e18);
    loanToken.approve(address(pool), type(uint).max);
    collateralToken.approve(address(pool), type(uint).max);
    pool.deposit(amount);
    pool.addCollateral(address(this), borrowAmount);
    pool.borrow(borrowAmount / 2);
    if(borrowAmount == 0) return;
    assertApproxEqAbs(pool.lastTotalDebt(), borrowAmount / 2, 1, "a");
    assertEq(pool.debtSharesBalanceOf(address(this)), pool.lastTotalDebt(), "b");
    pool.borrow(borrowAmount / 2);
    assertApproxEqAbs(pool.lastTotalDebt(), borrowAmount, 1, "c");
    assertEq(pool.debtSharesBalanceOf(address(this)), pool.lastTotalDebt(), "d");

    for (uint i; i<365;++i){
        vm.warp(block.timestamp + 1 days);
        pool.withdraw(0); // accrues interest
    }

    uint debt = pool.lastTotalDebt();
    uint expectedDebt = borrowAmount + (borrowAmount * 0.4e18 * 365 days / (365 days * 1e18));
    assertApproxEqAbs(debt, expectedDebt, 5, "e");
    pool.repay(address(this), debt);
    pool.withdraw(debt);
    pool.removeCollateral(borrowAmount);
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
If we use block numbers instead of timestamps and calculate the interest amount exponentially, this problem will be fixed. This will lead to the interest amount being more predictable for the borrower and the lender.

For example if we choose 0.1% interest per block and 3 blocks pass, the interest amount will be `0.1% ** 3 = 0.3003%` of the total debt instead of `0.1% * 3 = 0.3%`. This will lead to the interest amount being more predictable for the borrower and the lender and independent of how frequently the `getCurrentState` function gets called.
