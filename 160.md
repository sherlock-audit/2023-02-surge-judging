# Token supply and decimal precision can break the pool

## Summary
The pool has many calculations that will ultimately break if any of the tokens of the pool have a supply or decimal precision higher than a certain amount. But unfortunately, the pool does not check for any of these.

## Vulnerability Detail
The pool has many calculations like:

https://github.com/Surge-fi/surge-protocol-v1/blob/b7cb1dc2a2dcb4bf22c765a4222d7520843187c6/src/Pool.sol#L474
```solidity
uint userCollateralRatioMantissa = userDebt * 1e18 / collateralBalanceOf[msg.sender];
```
That will overflow and break if the `userDebt` is higher than `2^256 / 1e18`. For this pool, it might happen if for one of the tokens we have `decimals + log(2)(totalSupply) > 127`. Although many tokens will not have this problem, it is still a problem that the pool does not check for this. This can be easily fixed by checking for this before creating the pool.

## Impact
The factory might create a pool that will break if any of the tokens have a supply or decimal precision higher than a certain amount.

## Code Snippet
These foundry test cases show the vulnerability in action. The first test passes, but the second one doesn't.

First test (2**127, passes):
```solidity
function testCannotWithdrawHighAmountsOfTokenForHighSupplyTokens() external {
    uint amount = 2**127;
    MockERC20 collateralToken = new MockERC20(amount, 0);
    MockERC20 loanToken = new MockERC20(amount, 0);
    Pool pool = factory.deploySurgePool(IERC20(address(collateralToken)), IERC20(address(loanToken)), 1e18, 0.5e18, 1e15, 1e15, 0.1e18, 0.4e18, 0.6e18);
    loanToken.approve(address(pool), type(uint).max);
    pool.deposit(amount);
    console.log("We can successfully deposit!");
    pool.withdraw(amount);
    console.log("Yet we cannot withdraw, ever!!! Overflow will occur and we will not reach here!");
}
```

Second test (2**128, fails):

```solidity
function testCannotWithdrawHighAmountsOfTokenForHighSupplyTokens() external {
    uint amount = 2**128;
    MockERC20 collateralToken = new MockERC20(amount, 0);
    MockERC20 loanToken = new MockERC20(amount, 0);
    Pool pool = factory.deploySurgePool(IERC20(address(collateralToken)), IERC20(address(loanToken)), 1e18, 0.5e18, 1e15, 1e15, 0.1e18, 0.4e18, 0.6e18);
    loanToken.approve(address(pool), type(uint).max);
    pool.deposit(amount);
    console.log("We can successfully deposit!");
    pool.withdraw(amount);
    console.log("Yet we cannot withdraw, ever!!! Overflow will occur and we will not reach here!");
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
My recommendation is to check for the supply and decimal precision of the tokens before creating the pool. If any of the tokens have a supply and decimal precision that result in higher than a certain amount, the pool should not be created.

This can either happen in the `deploySurgePool` function or in the Pool contract constructor.
Something like this maybe:
    
```solidity
require(_loanToken.decimals() + _loanToken.totalSupply() < 128, "high supply token not supported");
```
