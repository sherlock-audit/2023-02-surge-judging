# Division by zero in Surge Pool

## Summary
There are places in the code where a division by zero error might happen and they are not gracefully handled.

## Vulnerability Detail

Some examples of this happening are in `removeCollateral` and `borrow` functions.

In `removeCollateral` function we have:
https://github.com/Surge-fi/surge-protocol-v1/blob/b7cb1dc2a2dcb4bf22c765a4222d7520843187c6/src/Pool.sol#L433
```solidity
uint userCollateralRatioMantissa = userDebt * 1e18 / (collateralBalanceOf[msg.sender] - amount);
```

Or in `borrow` we have:
https://github.com/Surge-fi/surge-protocol-v1/blob/b7cb1dc2a2dcb4bf22c765a4222d7520843187c6/src/Pool.sol#L474
```solidity
uint userCollateralRatioMantissa = userDebt * 1e18 / collateralBalanceOf[msg.sender];
```

Although I did not find any valid states that will result in a division by zero error, it is still a better idea to fail gracefully in these cases instead of division by zero error.

## Impact
Ungraceful failure in some cases.

## Code Snippet

Running this test will result in a division by zero error from the pool:
```solidity   
function testDivisionByZero() external {
    uint amount = 1e18;
    uint totalBorrowAmount = amount;
    vm.prank(address(1), address(1)); // address(1) is the borrower
    MockERC20 collateralToken = new MockERC20(amount, 18);
    MockERC20 loanToken = new MockERC20(amount, 18);
    Pool pool = factory.deploySurgePool(IERC20(address(collateralToken)), IERC20(address(loanToken)), 1e18, 0.5e18, 1e15, 1e15, 0.1e18, 0.4e18, 0.6e18);

    loanToken.approve(address(pool), type(uint).max);
    pool.deposit(amount);

    vm.prank(address(1), address(1));
    collateralToken.approve(address(pool), type(uint).max);
    vm.prank(address(1), address(1));
    pool.addCollateral(address(this), totalBorrowAmount);

    vm.prank(address(1), address(1));
    pool.borrow(totalBorrowAmount/2);
    vm.prank(address(1), address(1));
    pool.borrow(totalBorrowAmount/2);

    vm.warp(block.timestamp + 1 days);
    pool.withdraw(0);
    uint debtAmount = pool.lastTotalDebt();
    pool.liquidate(address(1), debtAmount);
    assertEq(pool.lastTotalDebt(), 0);
    assertEq(pool.collateralBalanceOf(address(1)), 0);
}
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
`require()` can be used to handle these cases gracefully.
