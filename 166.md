# If the decimals of collateral tokens is much higher than the decimals of loan tokens, the collateral ratio could be very low.

## Summary

To compute `userCollateralRatioMantissa`, the protocol uses `userDebt` and `collateralBalance` in the calculation. But they didnâ€™t share the same decimals. If the decimals of collateral tokens is much higher than the decimals of loan tokens, the collateral ratio could be very low.

## Vulnerability Detail

To compute `userCollateralRatioMantissa`, the protocol uses `userDebt` and `collateralBalance` in the calculation.
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-surge/blob/main/surge-protocol-v1/src/Pool.sol#L474
```solidity
        uint userDebt = getDebtOf(debtSharesBalanceOf[msg.sender], _debtSharesSupply, _currentTotalDebt) + amount;
        uint userCollateralRatioMantissa = userDebt * 1e18 / collateralBalanceOf[msg.sender];
        require(userCollateralRatioMantissa <= _currentCollateralRatioMantissa, "Pool: user collateral ratio too high");
```

`userDebt` should share the decimals of loan tokens. And `collateralBalance` shares the decimals of collateral tokens.

Suppose that the loan token is `USDC` with decimals 6 and the collateral token is `WETH` with decimals 18
* Alice calls addCollateral() with 10 WETH
```solidity
addCollateral(10 * 1e18)
collateralBalanceOf[Alice] = 10 * 1e18 = 1e19
```
* Alice calls borrow() with 1000000 USDC
```solidity
borrow(1000000 * 1e6)
userDebt[Alice] =1000000 * 1e6 = 1e12
```

* Then the userCollateralRatioMantissa of Alice is 1e11 // 0.00001%
```solidity
userCollateralRatioMantissa = userDebt * 1e18 / collateralBalanceOf[msg.sender]
= 1e12 * 1e18 / 1e19 = 1e11 // 0.00001%
```

In conclusion, if the decimals of collateral tokens is much higher than the decimals of loan tokens, the collateral ratio could be very low. 

## Impact

If the decimals of collateral tokens is much higher than the decimals of loan tokens, users can borrow lots of loan tokens with only a few collateral tokens. And they still have a very low collateral ratio.

## Recommendation

Normalize both `userDebt` and `collateralBalance` to the same decimals.
