# The Pool will fail to deliver in case of Fees on Transfer Tokens

## Summary

In Scope and doc, It is clearly mentioned that "any non-rebasing" ERC20 token can be used in this Pool. But While using Fees on Transfer Token, all the Logic of Smart Contract will fail.

## Vulnerability Detail

Some ERC20 tokens charge a fee for every transfer. If the underlying token of a vault is such a token any deposit to the protocol will fail.

Some tokens have the possibility of adding fees later on, e.g. USDT. So those have to be covered too.

Generally, the user would also receive fewer tokens on withdrawing in such a scenario. The codebase has not handled such tokens

## Impact

The Codebase will not work correctly with such tokens and can lead to loss of funds for some.

## Code Snippet

No checking of Actual deposit or adding of Collateral after deducting of fees in entire [codebase](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-surge/blob/main/surge-protocol-v1/src/Pool.sol#L1-L620).

## Tool used

VS Code

## Recommendation

Add Balance before and balance after check for every interaction of transfer of token and based on that update the State Variable.
