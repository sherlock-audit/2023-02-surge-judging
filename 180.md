# `approve` method can be frontrunned in some situations

## Summary
`approve` method can be frontrunned in some situations, leading to loss of user's funds.

## Vulnerability Detail
The `approve` method can be frontrunned in some specific circumstances, allowing an malicious allowance recipient to transfer more tokens than intended.

Consider the following scenario
1. Alice approves Bob to transfer N tokens by calling `approve(address(Bob), N)`
2. Some time later, Alice changes her mind and change Bob allowance to M (`approve(address(Bob), M)`).
3. Bob frontrun Alice's tx, transfer N tokens from her balance.
4. Bob waits for the previous Alice's tx and then transfer M tokens from her balance.

So Bob managed to transfer M+N tokens from Alice balance, more than Alice intended to allow.

## Impact
If users update their non-zero allowances to non-zero values, they could be susceptible to front-running by malicious recipients. This could lead to the malicious party transferring more funds than the user intended.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider adding the the `safeApprove` function below. This prevents the aforementioned exploit by only allowing non-zero allowances to be updated to zero. So the user will have split his update into two transactions (N -> 0, then 0 -> M), consequently avoiding the exploit.

```javascript
function safeApprove(address spender, uint amount) external returns (bool) {
    require((amount == 0) || (allowance[msg.sender][spender] == 0));
    allowance[msg.sender][spender] = amount;
    emit Approval(msg.sender, spender, amount);
    return true;
}
```
