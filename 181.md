# Steal liquidatable borrower's collateral using rounding down

## Summary

In `liquidate()` the share calculation of the repayment is rounding down. When the collateral token and loan token have different decimals, the rounding could be abused to steal liquidatable borrower's collateral. 

The mitigation is to add check for the share calculation results.


## Vulnerability Detail

Consider the following case, a pool with collateral of DAI, loan token of USDT. DAI has 18 decimal and USDT has 6 decimal.

Assuming the user `collateralBalance` is 200e18 DAI, `userDebt` is 100e6 USDT. `_currentTotalDebt` is 1,001e6 USDT, `debtSharesSupply` is 500e6 shares, the amount of debt per share is slightly larger than 2.
When repayment `amount` is 2 USDT, the `_shares` returned by `tokenToShares()` in line 587 would be 0, due to rounding down. However the `collateralReward` from line 585-586 would be: 2 * (200e18 * 1e18 / 100e6) / 1e18 = 4e12 DAI.


```solidity
570:         uint collateralBalance = collateralBalanceOf[borrower];

585:             uint userInvertedCollateralRatioMantissa = collateralBalance * 1e18 / userDebt;
586:             collateralReward = _amount * userInvertedCollateralRatioMantissa / 1e18; // rounds down
587:             _shares = tokenToShares(_amount, _currentTotalDebt, _debtSharesSupply, false);
588:         }
589:         _currentTotalDebt -= _amount;
590: 
591:         // commit current state
592:         debtSharesBalanceOf[_borrower] -= _shares;
593:         debtSharesSupply = _debtSharesSupply - _shares;
594:         collateralBalanceOf[_borrower] = collateralBalance - collateralReward;
```

Since in line 587, the `_shares` calculation is rounding down, it could result in 0.
```solidity
199:     function tokenToShares (uint _tokenAmount, uint _supplied, uint _sharesTotalSupply, bool roundUpCheck) internal pure returns (uint) {
200:         if(_supplied == 0) return _tokenAmount;
201:         uint shares = _tokenAmount * _sharesTotalSupply / _supplied;
202:         if(roundUpCheck && shares * _supplied < _tokenAmount * _sharesTotalSupply) shares++;
203:         return shares;
204:     }
```

The current state update would not have any effects on debt shares, `debtSharesBalanceOf[_borrower]` and `debtSharesSupply` will remain the same. But `collateralBalanceOf[_borrower]` will be reduced. 

The above can be repeated multiple times. The borrower would lose the collateral but still carry the debt shares. 


## Impact

Malicious user could abuse the arithmetic rounding to steal collateral fund from liquidatable borrower.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add the check for `_shares` after `tokenToShares()` to make sure the rounding down result is not 0.

```diff
585:             uint userInvertedCollateralRatioMantissa = collateralBalance * 1e18 / userDebt;
586:             collateralReward = _amount * userInvertedCollateralRatioMantissa / 1e18; // rounds down
587:             _shares = tokenToShares(_amount, _currentTotalDebt, _debtSharesSupply, false);
+                require(_shares > 0);
```
