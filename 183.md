# Borrowers could make repayment but without reduce the debt shares

## Summary

In `repay()` the share calculation of the repayment is rounding down. The rounding could result in the borrower's loss of fund for some edge cases. 

The mitigation is to add check for the share calculation results.


## Vulnerability Detail

Consider the following case, a pool with loan token of USDT. Assuming `_currentTotalDebt` is 1,001e6 USDT, `debtSharesSupply` is 500e6 shares, the amount of debt per share is slightly larger than 2.
When repayment `amount` is 2 USDT, the `_shares` returned by `tokenToShares()` in line 528 would be 0, due to rounding down. But the repayment will still be transferred.


```solidity
528:             _shares = tokenToShares(amount, _currentTotalDebt, _debtSharesSupply, false);
529:         }
530:         _currentTotalDebt -= amount;
531: 
532:         // commit current state
533:         debtSharesBalanceOf[borrower] -= _shares;
534:         debtSharesSupply = _debtSharesSupply - _shares;
535:         totalSupply = _currentTotalSupply;
536:         lastTotalDebt = _currentTotalDebt;
537:         lastAccrueInterestTime = block.timestamp;
```

In line 528, the `_shares` calculation is rounding down, it could result in 0.
```solidity
199:     function tokenToShares (uint _tokenAmount, uint _supplied, uint _sharesTotalSupply, bool roundUpCheck) internal pure returns (uint) {
200:         if(_supplied == 0) return _tokenAmount;
201:         uint shares = _tokenAmount * _sharesTotalSupply / _supplied;
202:         if(roundUpCheck && shares * _supplied < _tokenAmount * _sharesTotalSupply) shares++;
203:         return shares;
204:     }
```

The current state update would not have any effects on debt shares, `debtSharesBalanceOf[_borrower]` and `debtSharesSupply` will remain the same. However the debt amount will be reduced. 

The consequence is, the borrower would pay part the debt but still carry the same debt shares. 


## Impact

Borrowers could lose some fund in `repay()` due to arithmetic rounding errors.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add the check for `_shares` after `tokenToShares()` to make sure the rounding down result is not 0.

```diff
528:             _shares = tokenToShares(amount, _currentTotalDebt, _debtSharesSupply, false);
+                require(_shares > 0);
```
