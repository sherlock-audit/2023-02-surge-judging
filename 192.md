# Mismatched parameters for function selector for transfer

## Summary
Transfer cannot be recognised due to using of `uint` instead of `uint256` in IERC20.

## Vulnerability Detail

Transfer selector is defined as

>  bytes4 private constant TRANSFER_SELECTOR = bytes4(keccak256(bytes('transfer(address,uint256)')));

In our implementation of IERC20 transfer is defined as 

> function transfer(address, uint) external returns (bool);

Function selector would be different due to the usage of uint and uint256.

## Impact
Transfer cannot be called as the transfer function selector is calling it incorrectly.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider changing IERC20 interface implementation to 

```diff
- transfer(address, uint)
+ transfer(address, uint256)
```
