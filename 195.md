# Insufficient support for fee-on-transfer tokens

## Summary
The pool.sol do not support fee-on-transfer tokens. If tokenX is a fee-on-transfer token, tokens received/withdraw from users could be less than the amount specified in the transfer.


## Vulnerability Detail
pool.deposit, pool.withdraw, pool.addCollateral methods use address(this) amount tokenXAmount of tokenX tokens from the user and calculates the amount of shares to mint using the tokenXAmount. If fee-on-transfer tokens are used then the user would receive more shares than they should.
## Impact
The protocol and users could suffer a loss of funds.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider calculating the actual amount by recording the balance before and after.

For example:
```solidity
uint256 balanceBefore = baseToken.balanceOf(address(this));
baseToken.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), _amount);
uint256 balanceAfter = baseToken.balanceOf(address(this));
uint256 actualAmount = balanceAfter - balanceBefore;
```
