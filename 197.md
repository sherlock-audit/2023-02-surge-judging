# direct transfer of tokens to the pool

## Summary
Division rounding may affect the issuance of shares

## Vulnerability Detail
users may not receive shares in exchange for their deposits if the total loan asset amount has been manipulated through a large “donation” (anyone can transfer loan tokens to the pool directly and manipulate its balance.)

1. An attacker can deposit() 1 wei of asset token as a first depositor and get 1 wei of share,
2. Attacker sends 100e18-1 of loan tokens to the contract address and  loan token balance of the contract (`_supplied`) would be 100e18
`_loanTokenBalance = LOAN_TOKEN.balanceOf(address(this));`
`uint _supplied = _totalDebt + _loanTokenBalance;`
3- next user tries to deposit() 190 loan tokens and gets only 1 share
`shares = amount*shares/supplied = 190e18*1/100e18 = 1`
4- Attacker withdraw() his 1 share and gets the 50% of loan tokens (290/2 = 145)
So the attacker can get 45 more tokens easily, but the user has lost 45 tokens.

## Impact
Users may lose funds, especially at the early stages of a pool

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Use internal accounting to calculate balance of tokens in the contract
