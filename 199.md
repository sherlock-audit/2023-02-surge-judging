# TOKENS WITH LOWER NUMBER OF DECIMALS CAN PRODUCE WRONG RESULT

## Summary
many ERC20 tokens such as USDC and USDT only have 6 decimal places which will result in wrong calculations.
## Vulnerability Detail
pool.sol  and Factory.sol have many methods which do all the calculations by assuming all tokens to be 18 decimal as according to docs protocol uses all ERC20 tokens, so if there is a token being used in pool that have 6 decimal places it will result in in wrong calculations as there is no check in constructor that make sure that only tokens with 18 decimal places are being used when creating a new pool.
## Impact
Unexpected/wrong calculations in case of tokens like USDC and USDT.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Enforce the contract to work with only 18 decimal tokens with a require statement in the constructor.
