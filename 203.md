# 【Tomo-M#2】create safe version ERC20-approve function

## Summary

You should create a safe version of the ERC20 approve function like `safeTransfer` and `safeTransferFrom`.

## Vulnerability Detail

The Pool contract has `safeTransfer` and `safeTransferFrom` functions to prevent some attack vectors. However, there is no safe version of the ERC20-approve function.

Therefore it happens ["Multiple Withdrawal Attack"](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/738)

## Impact

It happens [Multiple Withdrawal Attack](https://github.com/ethereum/EIPs/issues/738)

## Code Snippet

```solidity
/// @notice Approves an address to spend pool tokens on behalf of the sender
/// @param spender The address of the spender
/// @param amount The amount of pool tokens to approve
/// @return bool that indicates if the operation was successful
function approve(address spender, uint amount) external returns (bool) {
    allowance[msg.sender][spender] = amount;
    emit Approval(msg.sender, spender, amount);
    return true;
}
