# Arithmetic Overflow in withdraw function

## Summary 
There is a potential for an arithmetic overflow when calculating the amount of tokens to withdraw in the `withdraw() ` function. This occurs when the balance of the caller is very large and the total supply of pool tokens is very small.

## Vulnerability Detail
 https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-surge/blob/main/surge-protocol-v1/src/Pool.sol#L367

Please pay attention :

```solidity
if (amount == type(uint).max) {
    amount = balanceOf[msg.sender] * (_currentTotalDebt + _loanTokenBalance) / _currentTotalSupply;
    _shares = balanceOf[msg.sender];
} else {
    _shares = tokenToShares(amount, (_currentTotalDebt + _loanTokenBalance), _currentTotalSupply, true);
}
```
If the above `amount` parameter passed into the function is the maximum value for a uint, the function calculates the amount of tokens to withdraw by multiplying the balance of the caller by the sum of the total debt and the balance of the loan token, and then dividing by the total supply of pool tokens. This may result in an overflow if the balance of the caller is very large and the total supply of pool tokens is very small. 
If the result of the multiplication is greater than the maximum value for a uint, then the division will not produce the expected result, leading to incorrect values for `_shares` and `amount`.

## Impact
It could lead to incorrect token balances and potentially cause loss of funds for users. 
If the multiplication operation in the calculation of amount results in an overflow, then the value of `_shares` and `amount `will be incorrect, which can lead to an incorrect number of tokens being withdrawn from the pool. 
If the user is withdrawing a large amount of tokens, this could result in a significant loss of funds.

## Code Snippet

## Tool used

### Manual Review

## Recommendation
It is important to ensure that the multiplication of the balance of the caller with the sum of the total debt and the balance of the loan token does not exceed the maximum value for a uint by implementing checks within the code to prevent such scenarios from occurring, such as limiting the maximum balance of the caller or increasing the total supply of pool tokens to accommodate larger balances.
