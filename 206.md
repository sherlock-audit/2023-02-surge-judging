# deposit(), withdraw(), borrow() and repay() doesn't have slippage protection

## Summary
Deposit and withdraw in Pool lacks of slippage control, deposit / withdraw transaction can be pending in the mempool for a long time and executes in very sub-optimal exchange rate

## Vulnerability Detail
A similar issue of EIP-4626 vaults is [described here](https://ethereum-magicians.org/t/address-eip-4626-inflation-attacks-with-virtual-shares-and-assets/12677), where a victim can be frontrun and impacted due to the absence of slippage protection in the deposit function.

As in most of the user's function calls code calculate share amount based on token amount which rely on the contract sate so the exact amount of the share that mints or burn can be different based on contract state changes and users may lose funds. attacker can perform front-running or sandwich attack to cause fund loss for users.

## Impact
 Without slippage control, users may experience unexpected losses or gains when depositing or withdrawing from the Pool contract. For example,

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add `minTokenShares` or analogous parameter (representing the expected Token shares minted) to the `deposit` function so that protection sellers can control the slippage on their deposits. and similar parameters for other functions
