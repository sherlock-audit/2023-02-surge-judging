# surge pool internal tokens doesn't always use 18 decimals

## Summary

In the Pool contract the internal pool tokens `decimals` value is set to 18 by default but the actual pool tokens doesn't always use the 18 decimals instead they have the same decimals as the Loan token.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the Pool contract the internal pool tokens `decimals` value is set by default to 18 and its value can't be changed later, but this `decimals` value isn't actually used in the pool logic instead the internal pool tokens uses the same decimals value as the Loan token which can be different from 18 decimals.

If you take a look at the `tokenToShares` function it contains this line of code : 

```solidity
if (_supplied == 0) return _tokenAmount;
```

So when the first depositor deposits a given amount of Loan token this same amount is minted as pool tokens shares and thus the pool tokens will use the same decimals value as the loan token, this will continue for all other depositors as there is no further calculation that account for the difference in decimals value, this will lead all the internal pool token balances to have the same decimal value as the loan token.

If for example the Loan token is USDT which has 6 decimals then the pool tokens will also have 6 decimals and not 18, this can cause problems for users or protocols which wants to integrate with the surge pool and use the wrong `decimals` value (use 18 decimals instead of 6 in the last example) in their logic by calling the view function `pool.decimals()` (which return the wrong 18 decimals value in some cases) and it might also lead to some issues in the future development of the surge protocol.

## Impact

The hardcoded `decimals` value for the surge pool internal tokens is not always correct and can cause problems for users or protocols which will use the surge pool in their business logic.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

To avoid any issue with the surge pool tokens `decimals` value i recommend one of the following options :

* Set the surge pool tokens `decimals` value directly in the Pool contract constructor and set it equal to the loan tokens decimals `LOAN_TOKEN.decimals()`.

* Modifie the surge pool contract logic to account for the difference in decimals between the loan token and the surge pool tokens (18).

I believe the first option is more convenient as it doesn't require further changes in the Pool contract logic.
