# 【Tomo-M#5】DOS repay function

## Summary

It happens DoS for repay function

## Vulnerability Detail

In the `repay()` function users repay their debt and decrease their debt.

```solidity
function repay(address borrower, uint amount) external {
        /* ...*/
        debtSharesBalanceOf[borrower] -= _shares;
```

This function is used to repay the debt by the borrower

An attacker can see this function and front-run to repay a single token for a borrower’s debt.

This attack is made possible by the following elements

- Anyone can repay the designated address's debt.
- The underflow occurs if there was even a little bit more repayment before the transaction trying to pay back all the debt.
- 1 wei token is worthless for 18 decimal tokens.

### Example

1. Debt: Tom = 10**18 DAI
2. Tom execute `repay()` to repay 10**18 DAI
3. An Eve doing a front-run and repaying 1 wei DAI for protocol before repaying by Tom.
4. Underflow definitely occurs here.
5. Finally, Tom’s transaction will return revert.

## Impact

A DoS on every user that repay his full debt (or enough that the difference between his total debt to what he pays his negligible)

## Code Snippet
```solidity
function repay(address borrower, uint amount) external {
        /* ...*/
        debtSharesBalanceOf[borrower] -= _shares;

Manual Review

## Recommendation

You should change like this.

- before

```solidity
function repay(address borrower, uint amount) external {
        /* ...*/
        debtSharesBalanceOf[borrower] -= _shares;
```

- after

```solidity
function repay(address borrower, uint amount) external {
        /* ...*/
        if(_shares > debtSharesBalanceOf[borrower]) {
		        debtSharesBalanceOf = 0;
        } else {
		            debtSharesBalanceOf[borrower] -= _shares;
        }
```
