# Setting Universal Fee For All Type Of Pools Could Be Problematic

## Summary
Protocol simply Setting the fee for all pools via ```setFeeMantissa()``` in ```Factory.sol``` contract file, Which is not economically significant form user perspective.

## Vulnerability Detail
Let say ```operator``` set a fixed amount of fee for all pools, Now there can be multiple pools with different types of tokens. For example a pool with USDC and other is pool With BTC or May be ETH. Now for These 2 pool operator set same fee amount. Now form user perspective it is becoming expensive in case of BTC/ETH pool, where its significantly cheaper with USDC to cover fee.

Its create a some sort of limitation to use some tokens only. 

```solidity
    function setFeeMantissa(uint _feeMantissa) external {
        require(msg.sender == operator, "Factory: not operator");
        require(_feeMantissa <= MAX_FEE_MANTISSA, "Factory: fee too high");
        if(_feeMantissa > 0) require(feeRecipient != address(0), "Factory: fee recipient is zero address");
        feeMantissa = _feeMantissa;
    }
```
