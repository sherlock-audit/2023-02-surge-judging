# Race condition in the ```approve``` function of ```Pool.sol```

## Summary

The ```approve``` function in ```Pool.sol``` is vulnerable to a race condition that might allow an approved spender to spend more tokens than intended.

## Vulnerability Detail

A token holder can change the allowance of a spender by calling the ```approve``` function. The spender can front run the call to ```approve``` to spend the previous allowance. When the new allowance is set the spender can transfer more tokens although the owner might have intended for the spender to only be able to spend the new allowance.

For example: The owner sets an allowance of 100 tokens for a spender. The owner then decided to decrease the allowance to 50 tokens. The spender sees this and front runs the call to ```approve``` to transfer 100 tokens, reducing the spender's allowance to 0. The call to ```approve``` then sets the spenders allowance to 50 tokens and the spender is can transfer an additional 50 tokens. The spender transferred 150 tokens instead of the intended 50 tokens.

## Impact

Spender can transfer more tokens than expected.

## Recommendation

Consider changing the logic of the ```approve``` function to increase or decrease the allowance instead of setting it directly.
