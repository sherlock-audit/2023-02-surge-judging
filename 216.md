# First Depositor/Eairly Depositors can effectively steal funds from later users

## Summary
To calculate the exchange rate for shares in  Pool.sol contract ```tokenToShares()``` function divides the total supply of shares by the totalAssets(supplied loanToken) of the ```pool```. 
```solidity
_tokenAmount * _sharesTotalSupply / _supplied;
```
The first deposit can mint a very small number of shares then donate ```loanToken``` to the pool to grossly manipulate the share price. When later depositor deposit into the vault they will lose value due to precision loss and the adversary will get profit.

## Vulnerability Detail
```solidity
 function deposit(uint amount) external { // @audit-info Depositing Loan Token For Shares. 
        uint _loanTokenBalance = LOAN_TOKEN.balanceOf(address(this));
        (address _feeRecipient, uint _feeMantissa) = FACTORY.getFee();
        
        .........
        .........

        uint _shares = tokenToShares(amount, (_currentTotalDebt + _loanTokenBalance), _currentTotalSupply, false);
        require(_shares > 0, "Pool: 0 shares");
        _currentTotalSupply += _shares;

        // commit current state
        balanceOf[msg.sender] += _shares;
        totalSupply = _currentTotalSupply;
        lastTotalDebt = _currentTotalDebt;
        lastAccrueInterestTime = block.timestamp;
        ........
        ........
        }
```

```solidity
    function tokenToShares (uint _tokenAmount, uint _supplied, uint _sharesTotalSupply, bool roundUpCheck) internal pure returns (uint) {
        if(_supplied == 0) return _tokenAmount;
        uint shares = _tokenAmount * _sharesTotalSupply / _supplied;
        if(roundUpCheck && shares * _supplied < _tokenAmount * _sharesTotalSupply) shares++;
        return shares;
    }
```

Share is calculated via ```tokenToShares()``` using the ```The total supply of shares of the pool``` and ```The total supplied loan tokens of the pool```. This can lead to exchange rate manipulation. 

For an example, an adversary can get a single share via depositing 1```loanToken``` initially. 
Minting the first share established a 1:1 ratio but then donating large amount of ```loanToken```(let say 1000) changed the ratio to 1:1000. 
Now any deposit lower than 1000 loanToken will suffer from precision loss and the attackers share will benefit from it.

## Impact
adversary can effectively steal funds from later users

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
should mints some share to a dead address to permanently lock the exchange rate:
