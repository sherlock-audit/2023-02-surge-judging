# Loss of user funds if a Pool is deployed with _surgeMantissa of 0

## Summary

If a Pool contract is deployed with a `_surgeMantissa` value of 0, and a small loan is made, the `getBorrowRateMantissa` function will try to divide by zero and revert. This vulnerability causes the Pool contract to permanently become inoperable, and users will be unable to withdraw loan tokens or collateral tokens, leading to a total loss of user funds.

## Vulnerability Detail
The vulnerability exists if the three conditions below are satisfied:

- `_surgeMantissa` is set to 0 when deploying a Pool contract
- `_totalDebt` is greater than 0 (as otherwise the `getCurrentState` function will return without calling `getBorrowRateMantissa`)
- `_util` is equal to 0

As an example, suppose Bob deploys a Pool contract with a `_surgeMantissa` value of 0 and Alice then deposits 2e18 of of the loan tokens. If Bob adds a small amount of collateral, he can then borrow 1 loan token (i.e. 1 wei). After doing so, `_totalDebt` will be equal to 1, and, because `(_totalDebt * 1e18)` will be less than `_supplied`, the `getUtilizationMantissa` function will return a value of 0 for `_util`, which is calculated as `(_totalDebt * 1e18) / _supplied` 

When the three conditions above are met, `getBorrowRateMantissa` will attempt to divide by `_surgeMantissa` (i.e. 0) and will revert. Please refer to the code snippet below.

The `getBorrowRateMantissa` function is called from the `getCurrentState` function. The `getCurrentState` function is called from the `deposit`, `withdraw`, `removeCollateral`, `borrow`, `repay` and `liquidate` functions, so if `getBorrowRateMantissa` reverts due to dividing by zero, then `getCurrentState` and all of those other functions will also revert, preventing users from withdrawing loan and collateral.

## Impact

This can be intentionally exploited by a malicious pool creator by first creating a Pool with a `_surgeMantissa` of 0, waiting for lenders and borrowers to deposit loan tokens and collateral tokens, and then borrowing a very small loan (e.g. of 1 wei of the loan token). As detailed above, this would then prevent the lenders and borrowers from withdrawing their loan tokens and collateral tokens, leading to a total loss of user funds and the Pool contract being permanently inoperable, as the most key external functions will all revert, and there will be no way to get the Pool contract out of this state.

The cost of carrying out this attack is negligible, as the malicious pool creator would only need to deposit sufficient collateral in order to make this loan of 1 wei of the loan token (i.e. depositing just a few wei of the collateral token could be sufficient).

Alternatively, this vulnerability could be exploited by a malicious third party (rather than a malicious pool creator) that notices that a pool creator has deployed a pool contract with a `_surgeMantissa` of 0.

## Code Snippet

The vulnerable `getBorrowRateMantissa` function is copied below. If `_util` and `_surgeMantissa` are both 0, the function will try to divide by zero.

```solidity
function getBorrowRateMantissa(uint _util, uint _surgeMantissa, uint _minRateMantissa, uint _surgeRateMantissa, uint _maxRateMantissa) internal pure returns (uint) {
        if(_util <= _surgeMantissa) {
            return (_surgeRateMantissa - _minRateMantissa) * 1e18 * _util / _surgeMantissa / 1e18 + _minRateMantissa; // is this optimized by the optimized?
        } else {
            uint excessUtil = _util - _surgeMantissa;
            return (_maxRateMantissa - _surgeRateMantissa) * 1e18 * excessUtil / (1e18 - _surgeMantissa) / 1e18 + _surgeRateMantissa; // is this optimized by the optimizer?
        }
    }
```

Manual Review

## Recommendation

In the constructor, add 
```solidity
require(_surgeMantissa > 0, "Pool: _surgeMantissa too low");
```
