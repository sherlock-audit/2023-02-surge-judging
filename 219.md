# ERC20 Tokens that do not have 18 decimals will make calculations for fee, interest and other variables



## Summary
The contract assumes that all ERC20 tokens have 18 decimals.

## Vulnerability Detail

There are common tokens ERC20 tokens which do not have 18 decimal places such as USDT. Decimals of 10e18 are used for the calculation of `RATE_CEILING` and `fee`

    `uint8 public constant decimals = 18;`

Thus These values are calculated incorrectly

## Impact

Incorrect fee and user debt calculation when decimals != 18
