# getCurrentState: When converting fee to fee_share, the latest loan_supplied should be used

## Summary
When converting fee to fee_share in getCurrentState, the stale loan_supplied is used.
## Vulnerability Detail
loan_supplied indicates the loan provided by the contract, including both loaned and unloaned LOAN_TOKEN.
In getCurrentState, the fee is converted to fee_share using the equation fee/loan_supplied == fee_share/share_totalSupply.
Since interest is added during the calculation, the `supplied` is stale at this point and `supplied + _interest` is the latest loan_supplied.
To go deeper, the fee itself should not be taken into account when calculating loan_supplied(according to the calculation of share in deposit(), the amount of LoanToken is sent to the contract only after the calculation), so the correct loan_supplied should be `supplied + _interest - fee `.
Since `supplied` is smaller than the latest loan_supplied, this results in a larger calculated fee_share and thus the protocol charges more fee.

```solidity
        uint _supplied = _totalDebt + _loanTokenBalance;
...
        uint _interest = _totalDebt * _borrowRate * _timeDelta / (365 days * 1e18); // does the optimizer optimize this? or should it be a constant?
        // 10. Update the total debt
        _currentTotalDebt += _interest;
        
        // 11. If there is no fee, return the current values
        if(_feeMantissa == 0) return (_currentTotalSupply, _accruedFeeShares, _currentCollateralRatioMantissa, _currentTotalDebt);
        // 12. Calculate the fee
        uint fee = _interest * _feeMantissa / 1e18;
        // 13. Calculate the accrued fee shares
        _accruedFeeShares = fee * _totalSupply / _supplied; // if supplied is 0, we will have returned at step 7
```
## Impact
Since `supplied` is smaller than the latest loan_supplied, this results in a larger calculated fee_share and thus the protocol charges more fee.

        // 13. Calculate the accrued fee shares
-       _accruedFeeShares = fee * _totalSupply / _supplied; // if supplied is 0, we will have returned at step 7
+       _accruedFeeShares = fee * _totalSupply / (_supplied + _interest - fee); // if supplied is 0, we will have returned at step 7
        // 14. Update the total supply
        _currentTotalSupply += _accruedFeeShares;
