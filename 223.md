# ```approve()``` Could Be Front-Runned

## Summary
```approve()``` could be front-runned, try to use ```increaseAllowance()``` or ```decreaeAllowance()``` instead of it.

## Vulnerability Detail
When any user ```approve()``` other user to spent his tokens,
For example I ```approve()``` You to spend my 10 Pool token on behalf me,
Then I changed my mind rather than 10 I approve you to spend 5 token only,
As You are malicious, by watching mem pool you front run my second transaction and spend 10 token then after again spent my 5 token.
In that way you able to spent 15, where i wish you to spend 5 only.

```solidity
    function approve(address spender, uint amount) external returns (bool) { // @audit-issue approve can be front runed
        allowance[msg.sender][spender] = amount;
        emit Approval(msg.sender, spender, amount);
        return true;
    }
```
