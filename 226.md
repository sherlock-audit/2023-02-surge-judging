# A malicious early user/attacker can manipulate pricePerShare to take an unfair share of future users' deposits

## Summary
A well known attack vector for almost all shares based liquidity pool contracts, where an early user can manipulate the price per share and profit from late users' provide because of the precision loss caused by the rather large value of price per share.
## Vulnerability Detail
A malicious early user can deposit() with 1 wei of LOAN_TOKEN as the first depositor of the LP Token, and get 1 wei of shares.

Then the attacker can send 10000e18 - 1 of LOAN_TOKEN and inflate the price per share from 1.0000 to an extreme value of 1.0000e22 ( from (1 + 10000e18 - 1) / 1) .

As a result, the future user who deposits 19999e18 will only receive 1 wei (from 19999e18 * 1 / 10000e18) of shares token.

They will lose 9999e18 or half of their deposit if they withdraw() .

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider requiring a minimal amount of share tokens to be minted for the first provider, and send a part of the initial mints as a reserve to the DAO so that the pricePerShare can be more resistant to manipulation.
