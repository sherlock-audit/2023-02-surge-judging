# Critical. Incorrect shares(pool tokens) calculation.

## Summary
SC: Pool.sol
Type: Critical. Incorrect shares(pool tokens) calculation.

-Attacker can send loan tokens to SC directly (without `deposit()` function) which leads to decrease share quantity of next users who will deposit loan tokens. 
-If userX sent loan tokens directly to SC (w/o `deposit` function), userY can steal these tokens if he  made deposit _before_ userX tx.

## Vulnerability Detail
Let's see at user shares portion, they made deposit one by one using `deposit` function and 1e18 loan token amount.

We do not take into account any collateral/loans repayments for clear vision.

Now let's assume that attacker sent 1e18 loan token to Pool right after deposit of user1. Then user2, user3, user4 will deposit same amount as at first example.

Result: Because `amount` in `withdraw()` function are calculated is calculated using exactly `shares` (not deposited loan tokens) it could lead to some unexpected consequences. For example, user1 in our case deposited 1e18 tokens but he could withdraw 2e18 loan tokens. 
Look normal case, every one successfully withdraw their funds:

But user1 can do it twice when attacker (or someone by mistake) sent loan tokens to SC:

Also, I suppose, there are some consequences in other debt/collateral/reward logic. Need time to check it deeply.

## Impact
Attackers can decrease share tokens of other user1 which can lead to unexpected loses. At least one example mentioned above.

Manual Review


## Recommendation
Best practice to avoid balanceOf() in important calculations like shares/reward. Use separately totalSupplyOfTokens() instead.
