# Users not allowed to repay/liquidate if token contract is paused

## Summary
Some token contracts like BNB have the pausable functionality. This means a user cannot repay his debt when he wants to if the token contract is paused at that moment. Also, it wouldn't allow anyone to liquidate a borrower if collateral or loan token contract is paused.
## Vulnerability Detail
Pausable contracts prevent users from interacting with them. In surge's Pools, if such a situation arises, the debt of the borrowers would keep on increasing forever and no one would be able to repay/liquidate to balance the debt.
## Impact
This is a medium severity issue because of the multi-layered impact.
1. Borrowers would not be able to repay loan at the right time causing forever increasing bad debt for them.
2. Depositors would not be able to withdraw their funds even if they need it or they know that the collateral token's value is decreasing in outside market. They will be forced to supply.
3. Liquidators will not be able to liquidate deteriorating positions leading to bad debt for all the lenders.
4. When and if the token contract gets unpaused, borrowers may have so much bad debt that they lose their entire collateral for no mistake of theirs.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The trick here is to pause accruing debt and interests if the loan/collateral token gets paused and store the current values until it gets unpaused. This can be done by halting the pool's interests when the token contract transfer calls revert with a Paused() error.
