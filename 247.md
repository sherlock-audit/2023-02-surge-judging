# First Depositor Can Break Minting of Shares

## Summary

Users may not receive shares in exchange for their deposits if the total asset amount has been manipulated through a large “donation”.


## Vulnerability Detail

       ` uint shares = _tokenAmount * _sharesTotalSupply / _supplied;`

Attacker deposits 2 wei to mint 1 share
Attacker transfers exorbitant amount to Pool to greatly inflate the share’s price. 

Future depositors instead have to deposit an equivalent sum to avoid minting 0 shares. Otherwise, their deposits accrue to the attacker who holds the only share.

## Impact

After this first deposit attack, future depositors do not get the correct share amount and thus lose funds.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Ensure number of shares minted is not zero.
Automatically send some shares to address(0) on creation of Pool
