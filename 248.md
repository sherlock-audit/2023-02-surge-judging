# possible approve(..) frontrun

nuel

Med
It is possible to frontrun approve(..) and get access to more token amount than intended

## Summary
the `approve` method in pool contract can frontrun to allow an account spend more token than intended

## Vulnerability Detail
say address A approves X amount of token for address B
If address A tries to update the approved amount for address B to say Y amount of token
address B can frontrun the transaction, hence making her elligible to spend (X+Y) amount of token

## Impact

## Code Snippet

`function approve(address spender, uint amount) external returns (bool) {

        allowance[msg.sender][spender] = amount;
        
        emit Approval(msg.sender, spender, amount);
        
        return true;
        
    }`

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
`approve` could take a third argument which corresponds to the initial token amount approved for an account,
if the current approved amount varies from this argument, aprroval should not suceed.
