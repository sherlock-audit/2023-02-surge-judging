# Can Emit False liquidation and invest events

## Summary

The “emit” happens before `safeTransfer` and `safeTransferFrom` steps. These transfer functions can revert after the emission when msg.sender does not have enough funds to compete the liquidation.

## Vulnerability Detail

When liuqidate is called, there is no check to see if msg.sender has enough funds to complete the liquidation. Instead, the code passes through the emit() step before ultimately failing at the safeTransferFrom step. This will misinform any protocols that interact with it or bots that rely on emissions.

## Impact

Misleading emissions for those `liquidation` and` invest`
