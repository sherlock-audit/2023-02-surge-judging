# Risk of market prices manipulation

## Summary
The pool uses the `LOAN_TOKEN.balanceOf(address(this))` to get the balance of `LOAN_TOKENS` on the pool. But the Loan tokens are supposed to be deposited or withdrawn from the pool. But Loan Token is an external token, then there is other means of depositing  tokens on the pool,  like simple calling transfer on the external token itself pointing the `to` address to the pool. The balance then will decrease the amount of user shares on the pool.

## Vulnerability Detail
1 - one user transfer external Loan Tokens to the pool.
2 - when another user calls `deposit` of `withdraw` the amount of `_shares` will be decreased.

## Impact
Wrong computation of `_shares` due to misleading balance of Loan Tokens.

## Code Snippet
[Pool.sol#L348](`https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-surge/blob/main/surge-protocol-v1/src/Pool.sol#L348`)
```solidity 
    function withdraw(uint amount) external {
        uint _loanTokenBalance = LOAN_TOKEN.balanceOf(address(this)); 
        ...
   }
```
[Pool.sol#L307](`https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-surge/blob/main/surge-protocol-v1/src/Pool.sol#L307`)
```solidity
    function deposit(uint amount) external {
        uint _loanTokenBalance = LOAN_TOKEN.balanceOf(address(this)); 
        ...
    }
```
## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Keeping track of the balance of Loan Tokens of the pool by using an state variable, i.e.: `uint256 externalTokenBalance;` and increases the balance on deposit and decrease the balance on withdrawals.
