# [M-2] `userCollateralRatioMantissa` should be lower than `_currentCollateralRatioMantissa`

## Summary

User's collateral ratio should be lower than maximum collateral ratio, otherwise liquidation may happen in short time.

## Vulnerability Detail

If the user borrows the maximum amount (`userCollateralRatioMantissa == _currentCollateralRatioMantissa`), the user's collateral may be liquidated immediately in the worst case. This is due to collateral devaluation, fees, etc. Frequent liquidation is harmful for both user and the protocol itself.

## Impact

Liquidation may happen in short time if user borrows at maximum collateral ratio.

## Code Snippet

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-surge/blob/main/surge-protocol-v1/src/Pool.sol#L475

```solidity
require(userCollateralRatioMantissa <= _currentCollateralRatioMantissa, "Pool: user collateral ratio too high");
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Change the `require()` statement to strictly less than:

```solidity
require(userCollateralRatioMantissa < _currentCollateralRatioMantissa, "Pool: user collateral ratio too high");
```

Also consider leaving a buffer between `userCollateralRatioMantissa` and `_currentCollateralRatioMantissa` so that liquidation won't come so fast.
