# Lack of validation in withdraw function to ensure amount withdrawn does not exceed loan tokens

## Summary
Lack of validation in `withdraw` function to ensure amount of withdrawn does not exceed loan tokens.

## Vulnerability Detail
There are no verifications to ensure that the `amount` passed to the `withdraw` function is not greater than the available balance of `LOAN_TOKEN`.

The contract derives the balance of `LOAN_TOKEN` held by the contract at the beginning of the function using the `_loanTokenBalance` variable, but does not check whether the amount parameter passed in exceeds this balance.

## Impact
Caller could withdraw more tokens than available, which could result in the caller losing pool tokens, and potentially affecting other users of the contract.
