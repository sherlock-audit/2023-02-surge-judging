# Adding Input Validation to Prevent Zero Amount Inputs

## Summary
All Core functions of Pool contract such as `deposit(), withdraw(), addCollateral(), removeCollateral(), borrow(), repay(), liquidate()` has a lack amount input validation.

## Vulnerability Detail
The current implementation of the smart contract does not include a check to ensure that the amount input for all main functions is not equal to zero. This means that it is possible for zero amounts to be input, which can lead to unexpected behavior and potentially be used for malicious purposes.

## Impact
Although this behavior does not change the state of the variables, it can result in event spam and potentially be used for scamming in third-party applications. Additionally, this behavior can be used to simulate pool activity, which can be misleading and result in inaccurate data being reported to third-party applications. It is important to ensure that the behavior of the smart contract is accurately represented and reported to prevent potential issues and maintain the trust of users and third-party applications.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Recommended to add a check to ensure that the amount input is not equal to zero in all core functions. This will help prevent unexpected behavior and ensure that the contract functions as intended.
