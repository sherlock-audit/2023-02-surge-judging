# Liquidate and repay functions will round down because roundUpCheck is set to false

## Summary
The roundUpCheck ensures that calculations are rounded up by 1 if they have been rounded down by solidity. Use it consistently in repay and liquidate function.
## Vulnerability Detail
The liquidate and repay functions must use true when calling the tokenToShares function to prevent precision loss in debtShares. 
For small amounts, this may even lead to zero because of solidity rounding down. 
## Impact
Wrong calculation of shares. When a small borrower repays his amount will be paid but the debtSharesBalanceOf will not be decreased because shares may round down to zero.
