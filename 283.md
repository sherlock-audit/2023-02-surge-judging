# BorrowRate can exceed ceiling

## Summary

BorrowRate can be much higher than the rate ceiling for collateralRatios larger than 1.

## Vulnerability Detail

The [blog](https://medium.com/surge-fi/introduction-to-surge-protocol-overview-34cc828d7c50) states an example of a pool that starts with a collateralRatio of 50. Such pools can make sense if one unit of the collateral token is worth much more than 1 unit of the loan token. In such pools the utilization will also be bigger than 1 (or 100%). This is not considered in the borrowRate calculation and can cause larger borrow rates than expected:

```js
return (_maxRateMantissa - _surgeRateMantissa) * 1e18 * excessUtil / (1e18 - _surgeMantissa) / 1e18 + _surgeRateMantissa; 
```

## Impact

BorrowRate is not actually capped at 10000% APR and can spiral out of control.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
cap the borrowRate to the `RATE_CEILING` in the borrow rate calculation.
