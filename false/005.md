# Protocol cannot handle fee-on-transfer tokens

## Summary
According to the documentation, the protocol states it accepts all ERC20 tokens. However it doesn't have the necessary measures to support fee-on-transfer tokens correctly.
## Vulnerability Detail
Tokens like USDT on the mainnet are actually fee-on-transfer tokens with fee currently set to 0. For fee on transfer tokens, the actual amount received is different from the amount passed as an argument to the contract. The protocol does all calculations based on the argument passed, and not based on how many tokens they actually received. Thus this leads to accounting errors where users who paid more fees can claim an unfair share of the pot.
## Impact
Incorrect accounting for fee on transfer tokens.
## Code Snippet
Here, deposit function mints shares based on the passed `amount`.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Check for the actual number of tokens received, by recording both the balance before and after the transfers.
