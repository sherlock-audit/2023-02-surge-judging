# Borrower cannot repay debt

## Summary
In certain circumstances it is possible that borrowers might not be able to pay theirs debt, and so their collateral tokens will be locked.

## Vulnerability Detail
As describe on issue "Borrower can lose funds" it is possible for a borrower to pay more than how s/he should. This opens a scenario where a borrower does pay also the debt of all borrowers. Then next borrowers cannot repay their debt as the function `Pool.repay` will revert on integer underflow which happens on LOC:https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-surge/blob/main/surge-protocol-v1/src/Pool.sol#L530, as `_currentTotalDebt` is equal to `0`, and thus `_currentTotalDebt -= amount;` will revert.

## Impact
Borrower cannot recover collateral.
