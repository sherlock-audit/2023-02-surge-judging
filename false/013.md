# Centralization risk: operator have privileges: set the fee recipient, set fee and add operator

## Summary

## Vulnerability Detail
Control by a few large players: As DeFi protocols and platforms gain popularity, they may become dominated by a few large players who control a significant portion of the ecosystem. This can lead to a concentration of power and influence, which may be used to manipulate prices, make decisions that benefit only certain groups, or even sabotage the ecosystem.
## Impact
operator have privileges: set the fee recipient,  set fee, add operator.
## Code Snippet

```solidity
    function setFeeRecipient(address _feeRecipient) external {
        require(msg.sender == operator, "Factory: not operator");
        feeRecipient = _feeRecipient;
    }
```

```solidity
    function setFeeMantissa(uint _feeMantissa) external {
        require(msg.sender == operator, "Factory: not operator");
        require(_feeMantissa <= MAX_FEE_MANTISSA, "Factory: fee too high");
        if(_feeMantissa > 0) require(feeRecipient != address(0), "Factory: fee recipient is zero address");
        feeMantissa = _feeMantissa;
    }
