# Added collateral could be lost if there's an error in inputting address in Pool.addCollateral

## Summary
Missing address 0 check in addCollateral
## Vulnerability Detail
When adding collateral via addCollateral, it does not check for input error 0 of the "to" input.
If, for some reason (e.g. frontend error), address 0 is passed, the tokens are added to collateralBalanceOf[address 0] which means the user could not withdraw those tokens anymore. 

While it's also possible that an user inserts a wrong address and without a possibility to check that I think the chance of an error inputting address 0 should be avoided if possible since there's not mechanism to recover collateralBalanceOf[].
