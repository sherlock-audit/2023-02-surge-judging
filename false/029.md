# `safeTransfer` and `safeTransferFrom` lacks contract check

## Summary
Low-level calls to non-existent contracts always return true, with zero data.length. In current implementation, `safeTransfer` and `safeTransferFrom` will not revert if supplied token address does not exist, and will instead act as if the transaction was executed normally.
## Vulnerability Detail
According to the [solidity docs](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/v0.8.17/control-structures.html#error-handling-assert-require-revert-and-exceptions), low-level calls to non-existent contracts always return true. Thus the current implementation of the safe transfer functions raises no error if the tokens passed do not exist.
The correct way of implementing the safe transfer functions, as is seen on the openzeppelin libraries, also does a check on the destination addresses's bytecode, to verify the contract exists. 
```solidity
bytes memory returndata = address(token).functionCall(data, "SafeERC20: low-level call failed");
```
The function `functionCall` is implemented in the Address library of openzeppelin, which does the contract code length check

This ensures that calls to non-existent contracts revert.
## Impact
Insufficient checks in safe-transfer functions

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add a simple code length check in the safe transfer functions
```solidity
require(token.code.length > 0, "Not a contract");
```
