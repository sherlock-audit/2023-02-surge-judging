# `operator` is not set in a secure manner; core protocol functionality can be lost

## Summary

The initial operator for the protocol is set in the Factory constructor with a provided address but there are no checks being done. A typo or `address(0)` mistake will leave the protocol without the capability to set fees.

## Vulnerability Detail

In `Factory.sol` the initial operator is set in the constructor with a provided address. There are no checks being done. 

[code](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-surge/blob/main/surge-protocol-v1/src/Factory.sol#L21-L22)
```Solidity
    constructor(address _operator, string memory _poolSymbolPrefix) {
        operator = _operator;
```
`operator` is a special privileged actor that has the power to set the recipient for all the fees collected by the protocol (`setFeeRecipient`) as well as the fee amount (`setFeeMantissa`).

Also, only the operator can choose to initialize the 2 step procedure to have another operator

[code](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-surge/blob/main/surge-protocol-v1/src/Factory.sol#L70-L73)
```Solidity
    function setPendingOperator(address _pendingOperator) external {
        require(msg.sender == operator, "Factory: not operator");
        pendingOperator = _pendingOperator;
    }
```

Although the protocol understands the importance of the operator and implemented a 2 step mechanism for changing it, it does no validation on the initial setup.

## Impact

If by mistake an initial, unintended, address is set as the operator, no fees can ever be extracted from the protocol.

## Code Snippet


## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Set the original `operator` with the address of the deployer of the contract. It can then be changed via the already implemented, 2 step procedure.

Example implementation:

```Solidity
    constructor(string memory _poolSymbolPrefix) {
        operator = msg.sender;
        POOL_SYMBOL_PREFIX = pack(_poolSymbolPrefix);
    }
```
