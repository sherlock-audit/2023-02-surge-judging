# Out of gas when iterating Pools state variables in Factory

## Summary

Out of gas when iterating Pools state variables in Factory

## Vulnerability Detail

Factory contract contains `pools` array which is public and based on comment on line 44, there will be an iteration for all pools using its array's length.

This issue is very common which will lead to out of gas when the `pools` array is large enough, thus iterating will be failed at some point. 

For example, an attacker might just generate some spam pools, then the `deploySurgePool` will increase the pools length (`pools.push(pool);`)

## Impact

Iteration of `pools` may run out of gas and revert due to long list of pools array.

```solidity
File: Factory.sol
19:     Pool[] public pools;
...
42:     /// @notice Get the number of deployed pools
43:     /// @return uint number of deployed pools
44:     /// @dev Useful for iterating on all pools
45:     function getPoolsLength() external view returns (uint) {
46:         return pools.length;
47:     }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

create a custom function to iterate pools by using start and end index (range variable) to mitigate the out of gas
