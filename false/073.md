# In case if user is blocked by token, he can't withdraw funds from Pool

## Summary
In case if user is blocked by token, he can't withdraw funds from Pool. This is because there is no receiver param inside `removeCollateral` and `withdraw` functions.
## Vulnerability Detail
It's possible that during the time after use deposit loan token or provided collateral tokens to the Pool, he will be blocked by token(for example USDC).
In this case it will not possible for him to withdraw them back. This is because both `removeCollateral` and `withdraw` functions send tokens to msg.sender and doesn't have `recipient` param.
## Impact
Blocked user can't get funds back.
