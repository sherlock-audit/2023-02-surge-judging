# A malicious depositor can manipulate withdrawals to increase utilisation rate of low liquidity pools & thereby increase accrued interest paid by borrowers

## Summary
In previous submission, I showed how a depositor can cause surge by withdrawing loan tokens from pool & systematically trigger liquidations. In this submission, I show how loan token withdrawals that don't cause a surge but increase accrued interest paid by borrowers. A depositor can also double up as a borrower to achieve a similar effect. This is especially effective with low liquidity / newly created pools.

A withdrawal of loan tokens will increase utilisation rate, all other things equal. Increasing utilisation rate increases pool interest rate based on linear interpolation between `min interest rate` and `surge interest rate`. Increase in pool interest rate increases accrued interest paid by borrowers. 

A malicious depositor can calculate a fixed withdrawal amount that increases his accrual earnings more than interest income forgone because of that withdrawal. 

Net-net depositor withdraws partial deposit and yet makes higher accrued interest during the period (refer POC). Current interest model needs to be changed from linear to slightly concave to prevent slow bleed of interest paid by borrowers

## Vulnerability Detail

[Pool interest rate](https://github.com/Surge-fi/surge-protocol-v1/blob/b7cb1dc2a2dcb4bf22c765a4222d7520843187c6/src/Pool.sol#L175) is dependent on the current utilisation rate, surge threshold, minimum rate (at 0% utilisation), surge interest rate (at surge threshold) & maximum rate (at 100% utilisation). Apart from the first variable, note that everything else is constant & immutable over the life of the pool. 

Interest rate model is a linear interpolation between min, surge and max rates depending on current utilisation rate. General rule is - as utilisation rate increases, interest charged by pool increases. So for a fixed increase in utilisation rate (`delta_u`), increase in interest rate is always fixed `(surge_rate - min_rate)*delta_u / surge_threshold`

To achieve a fixed change (`delta_u`) in utilisation, assuming total debt stays constant, a depositor needs to withdraw lesser and lesser amount of loan tokens from the pool. For eg, for a pool with 7 million debt + 3 million loan tokens in pool (total supply: 10m), first 7.77% increase in utilisation rate can be achieved by withdrawing 1 million loan tokens. To achieve next 7.77% increase in utilisation, we only need to withdraw 800k tokens.

Keeping the 2 points in view, let's see how a depositor can maximize interest for low liquidity pools..

- Say Alice is a depositor who holds P% of pool share `(0 < P < 100%)`
- Let's say total outstanding debt is `D`
- Over time `delta_t` for a rate `r` -> Alice would earn `P% * D * r * delta_T` - let's call this `Payout_current`

**Alice withdraws loan tokens to increase the pool utilization rate by `delta_u` **

- New interest rate is `r_new` equals `r + (surge_rate - min_rate)*delta_u / surge_threshold`
- Alice's share reduces to `P_new` where `P_new < P`
- Over same time `delta_t` for a rate `r_new` -> Alice would earn `P_new% * D * r_new * delta_T` - let's call this `Payout_new`

- So long as `Payout_new > Payout_current`, Alice can reduce her risk by withdrawing loan tokens & yet earn more reward (accrued interest) than before

- As stated above, at every step, Alice needs to withdraw lesser and lesser amount of loan tokens to achieve the same increase in utilisation rate (assuming total debt is same)

- As soon as utilisation goes close to Surge, Alice can deposit all loan tokens withdrawn and drop utilisation rate. And repeat the whole process again. (Surge creates liquidation risks that Alice can avoid by re-depositing withdrawn tokens)

## Impact
Manipulated increase in utilisation rates leads to increase in interest rate for borrowers. Since there is no free lunch, the cost of this manipulation is borne by all other genuine borrowers in the pool. Attacker can pilfer small amounts from borrowers in low liquidity pools by calibrating her withdrawals - attacker is reducing her risk by withdrawing & earning additional interest while doing this (best of both worlds).

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
In my view, key vulnerability here is the linear interest rate model - for a fixed change in utilisation rate, current interest model increases rates by a fixed amount. It does not matter how low or high actual utilisation is, so long as it is below surge threshold. Only boundary condition where slope changes to another constant value is when utilisation hits the surge level


Recommend an interest rate model that is montonously increasing but concave in shape, ie. as utilisation rates moves closer to surge, interest rates increase but at a decreasing rate. A depositor is less likely to withdraw deposits & still achieve higher accrued income if interest rate model is concave.
