# Token approval can be front-run

## Summary

Changing an allowance with `approve` can allow the approved to use both the old and the new allowance by taking advantage of transaction ordering.

## Vulnerability Detail

Front-running can be performed if someone calls approve with a non-zero value, and then again with a non-zero value.

So, consider if user A previously approved user B to take N tokens, and then wishes to change the approval from N to M. If they call `approve(M)`, the attacker can front-run the call. They could quickly take N tokens, wait for the `approve` transaction to complete, and then take another M tokens.

## Impact

In these situations, the approved spender can spend more than the owner intended.

## Recommendation

While `approve` is required as part of the ERC-20 spec, `decreaseAllowance` and `increaseAllowance` functions are commonly used to mitigate the these issues around setting allowances. The following snippets are from the OZ ERC-20 implementation.
```solidity
    function decreaseAllowance(address spender, uint256 subtractedValue) public virtual returns (bool) {
        address owner = _msgSender();
        uint256 currentAllowance = allowance(owner, spender);
        require(currentAllowance >= subtractedValue, "ERC20: decreased allowance below zero");
        unchecked {
            _approve(owner, spender, currentAllowance - subtractedValue);
        }

        return true;
    }
```
```solidity
    function increaseAllowance(address spender, uint256 addedValue) public virtual returns (bool) {
        address owner = _msgSender();
        _approve(owner, spender, allowance(owner, spender) + addedValue);
        return true;
    }
```
