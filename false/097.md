# Pool fees are incorrectly calculated which may allow users to avoid fees entirely

## Summary
Users can deposit and withdraw from the lending pool where each transaction to these functions may result in a fee however, these fees may be incorrectly calculated. 

## Vulnerability Detail
When a user deposits to a pool, the LP tokens are minted 1:1 of which ever token was deposited. For example, if a user deposits 
`10000000000` USDC, they will receive `10000000000` LP Tokens. As the fees are taken from the shares and share fees are divided by `1e18`, this means that the fee receivers will not receive their share of tokens should tokens such as USDC or USDT be used. 

## Impact
This was rated a medium in severity because while no substantial harm is done to the users or deposited funds, Pool administrators may miss out on a substantial amount of fees paid by the protocol.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
I recommend implementing an interface that is is included in the `Pool.sol` contract file which specifically returns the number of decimals a token uses:
```solidity
interface IDecimals {
   function decimals() external returns(uint256);
}
```

This interface can be used whenever the developer needs to dynamically use the decimals for a particular token. Fee calculation can be done by using the interface instead of hardcoding `1e18` similarly to the following:
```solidity
        uint fee = _interest * _feeMantissa /  10**IDecimals(address(asset)).decimals());
```
