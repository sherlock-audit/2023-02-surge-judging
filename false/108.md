# A user can force Liquidate another user with a flash loan attack

## Summary
A user can force liquidate another user with a flash loan to add Total Debt which is used to calculate the liquidity of a user's position. With the flash loan a malicious user can force liquidate another user's collateral. The malicious user can then liquidate the other user while repaying the loan. 

## Vulnerability Detail
Consider the lines inside following function liquidate 

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-surge/blob/main/surge-protocol-v1/src/Pool.sol#L572-L573


The function liquidate calculates the liquidity of a user's position inside of the function getDebtof https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-surge/blob/main/surge-protocol-v1/src/Pool.sol#L405-L410

upon further inspection, we can see that a user's debt is increased when _totaldebt is increased. 

TotalDebt is increased when a user calls borrow. 

Therefore, a malicious user (lets call him Bob) can liquidate and take the collateral of another user (lets call her Alice) with a flash loan attack.

The steps will be as follows:

1. Bob take out a flash loan from another protocol then calls borrow 

2. After calling borrow, the total Debt of the pool contract is increased

3. Alice's position which was originally safe, is in danger of being liquidated

4. Bob liquidates Alice and takes her collateral

5. Bob calls the function repay to get his flash loan funds back

6. Bob repays the loan


## Impact
A user collateral can be stolen with a flash loan attack
