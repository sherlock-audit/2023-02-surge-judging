# Attackers can force surge to never update the collateralization ratio

## Summary

Certain parameter choices make it feasible to block updates to the  collateralization ratio. Collaterization ratio updates are calculated as `uint change = timeDelta * _maxCollateralRatioMantissa / _collateralRatioRecoveryDuration; `. However, with quick refreshes or a `_collateralRatioRecoveryDuration` that is greater than `_maxCollateralRatioMantissa`, this change may be zero every iteration.

## Vulnerability Detail

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-surge/blob/main/surge-protocol-v1/src/Pool.sol#L216-L263

The `getCollateralRatioMantissa` function calculates the collateralization ratio by linearly updating along `_maxCollateralRatioMantissa / _collateralRatioRecoveryDuration`. However, these updates may be forced to zero in certain situations.

Consider a pool where the loan token is WBTC and the collateral token is DAI. Given a BTC price of $20,000 it is reasonable to only allow 1/10000 BTC to be borrowed per DAI (for a max rate of $10,000 per BTC).

The `_maxCollateralRatioMantissa` in this case would be `1e14`. In the Surge tests, a `_collateralRatioRecoveryDuration` of `1e15` is used. If an attacker does a tiny deposit of 1wei WBTC more often than once every 10 seconds, the `change` of the max collateralization ratio will always be zero no matter what the current utilization is because `(timeDelta * _maxCollateralRatioMantissa)` is less than `_collateralRatioRecoveryDuration`.

This would halt the entire adaptive pricing scheme of the Surge protocol while still allowing borrows at the current rate.

The README specifies that Surge is meant to be deployed on `DEPLOYMENT: Mainnet, Optimism, Arbitrum, Fantom, Avalanche, Polygon, BNB Chain and other EVM chains`. This exploit is especially attractive on L2s because of cheap/free execution (e.g. Optimism) and very low block times (thus low `timeDelta`).

## Impact

Loss of funds for depositors as the price becomes stale and the collateralization rate, and thus pool exchange rate, of the Surge pool would no longer update.

## Recommendation

Ensure that `_collateralRatioRecoveryDuration < _maxCollateralRatioMantissa`. This would preclude some pools from existing, but save funds from being stolen.
