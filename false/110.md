# Loss of funds in Pool.sol

## Summary
Access control isn't implemented in some critical functions found in Pool.sol

## Vulnerability Detail
withdraw() function can be used by anyone to drain the Loan_tokens in Pool.sol because anyone can interact with it. 
 
removeCollateral() function has a similar vulnerability.

## Impact
The withdraw() function allows users to withdraw loan tokens from the pool in exchange for pool tokens. The function first gets the current state of the pool using the 'getCurrentState' function, similar to the deposit function.

The function then calculates the number of pool tokens to burn based on the loan token amount and the current state of the pool using the 'tokenToShares' function. If the user wants to withdraw their entire balance, they can pass in the maximum uint value instead of an amount.

The pool tokens are burned and the current state of the pool is updated, including the balances of the user and the fee recipient, the total supply of pool tokens, the last accrue interest time, and the last collateral ratio. Finally, loan tokens are transferred to the user using the 'safeTransfer' function, which is assumed to be a safe transfer method that prevents reentrancy attacks.

However, without access control mechanisms, any user can call this function, including unauthorized users who may not have the necessary pool tokens to burn or the right to withdraw from the pool. **This can lead to potential security risks and loss of funds for the pool and its users**. It is recommended to implement access control mechanisms, such as whitelisting, to ensure that only authorized users can call this function.

2. Secondly a user can withdraw Loan tokens that he didn't deposit.

removeCollateral() vulnerability is similar to withdraw()'s own

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Implement whitelisting and also put a check to ensure that users can only withdraw the tokens they deposited and not the funds of other users.
