# [H-4] Inability to use critical pool functions when _surgeMantissa is 0

## Summary

Due to improper error handling, getBorrowRateMantissa() will fail when dividing by 0

## Vulnerability Detail

A pool can be deplyed with `_surgeMantissa` set to `0`. There are no safeguards preventing this edge case from occuring. Whenever getBorrowRateMantissa() is called it will revert due to `((_surgeRateMantissa - _minRateMantissa) * 1e18 * _util) / _surgeMantissa` failing.

## Impact

`getBorrowRateMantissa()` and `getCurrentState()` will revert anytime `_surgeMantissa` is `0`. Since getCurrentState() is used in almost all of the critical functions in Pool.sol, there would be a significant impact to the ability to even use a deployed pool in it's intended manner.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Implement checks when deploying the pool to make sure `_surgeMantissa` is not set to 0 or implement error handling in `getBorrowRateMantissa()` to return a predetermined value whenever `_surgeMantissa` is 0.
