# The feeRecipient has to pay fees to receive his fees

## Summary

The feeRecipient has to pay fees to receive his fees.

## Vulnerability Detail

After every call to getCurrentState() (from deposit(), withdraw(), removeCollateral(), borrow() and repay()), some fees are paid to the feeRecipient.

[Pool.getCurrentState()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-surge/blob/main/surge-protocol-v1/src/Pool.sol#L161-L163)

```solidity
        uint fee = _interest * _feeMantissa / 1e18;
        // 13. Calculate the accrued fee shares
        _accruedFeeShares = fee * _totalSupply / _supplied; // if supplied is 0, we will have returned at step 7
```

The fees is then added to the balanceOf mapping. 

[Pool.borrow()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-surge/blob/main/surge-protocol-v1/src/Pool.sol#L491-L494)

```solidity
        if(_accruedFeeShares > 0) {
            balanceOf[_feeRecipient] += _accruedFeeShares;
            emit Transfer(address(0), _feeRecipient, _accruedFeeShares);
        }
```
This fees is in the shares format and not loan token format. The only way for the fee recipient to withdraw his fees is for him to call `withdraw()`, which exchanges the share tokens into loan tokens. However, `withdraw()` also calls getCurrentState() and pays a small fee to the fee recipient.

```solidity
    function withdraw(uint amount) external {
        uint _loanTokenBalance = LOAN_TOKEN.balanceOf(address(this));
        (address _feeRecipient, uint _feeMantissa) = FACTORY.getFee();
        (  
            uint _currentTotalSupply,
            uint _accruedFeeShares,
            uint _currentCollateralRatioMantissa,
            uint _currentTotalDebt
        ) = getCurrentState(
            _loanTokenBalance,
            _feeMantissa,
            lastCollateralRatioMantissa,
            totalSupply,
            lastAccrueInterestTime,
            lastTotalDebt
        );


        uint _shares;
        if (amount == type(uint).max) {
            amount = balanceOf[msg.sender] * (_currentTotalDebt + _loanTokenBalance) / _currentTotalSupply;
            _shares = balanceOf[msg.sender];
        } else {
            _shares = tokenToShares(amount, (_currentTotalDebt + _loanTokenBalance), _currentTotalSupply, true);
        }
        _currentTotalSupply -= _shares;


        // commit current state
        balanceOf[msg.sender] -= _shares;
        totalSupply = _currentTotalSupply;
        lastTotalDebt = _currentTotalDebt;
        lastAccrueInterestTime = block.timestamp;
        lastCollateralRatioMantissa = _currentCollateralRatioMantissa;
        emit Divest(msg.sender, amount);
        emit Transfer(msg.sender, address(0), _shares);
        if(_accruedFeeShares > 0) {
            balanceOf[_feeRecipient] += _accruedFeeShares;
            emit Transfer(address(0), _feeRecipient, _accruedFeeShares);
        }


        // interactions
        safeTransfer(LOAN_TOKEN, msg.sender, amount);
    }
```

## Impact

The fee recipient has to pay fees to withdraw his fees.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

In the `withdraw()` function, check if the msg.sender is the feeRecipient. If it is, then skip the getCurrentState() function and simply convert the shares to loan tokens and transfer the amount back to the fee recipient. Otherwise, have a special function specifically for the fee recipient to withdraw his fees.
