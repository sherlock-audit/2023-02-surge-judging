# Attackers could take risk free loan token from pool while the market price of Collateral token falls rapidly

## Summary
The ````lastCollateralRatioMantissa```` is updated at a fixed linear rate, while the market price of collateral token falls faster than it, attackers could take risk free loan token from pool.

## Vulnerability Detail
Let's say
```solidity
CollateralToken = ETH
LoanToken = DAI
MAX_COLLATERAL_RATIO_MANTISSA = 85%
COLLATERAL_RATIO_FALL_DURATION = 10 days
lastCollateralRatioMantissa = 85%
priceOfETH = 1000 DAI
```
As shown on L252, ````lastCollateralRatioMantissa```` is updated at a fixed linear rate on time
```solidity
File: surge-protocol-v1\src\Pool.sol
216:     function getCollateralRatioMantissa(
...
225:         ) internal pure returns (uint) {
226:         unchecked {
...
251:                 uint timeDelta = _now - _lastAccrueInterestTime;
252:                 uint change = timeDelta * _maxCollateralRatioMantissa / _collateralRatioFallDuration;
...
263:     }

```
Hence, the minimum ````lastCollateralRatioMantissa```` after 1 day would be
```solidity
85% - 85% * (1 day / 10 days) = 76.5%
```

But if ETH's price falls rapidly from 1000 to 700 in 1 day, now attackers can
```solidity
buy 1 ETH from market at 700 DAI
loan 765 DAI from pool with 1 ETH
get 765 - 700 = 65 DAI profit
repeat to drain out all loan token
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Due to lack of tracking of the market price, this risk cannot be completely eliminated. However, we can use better math tools to reduce this risk, the exponential functions should be a better option than the current linear function.
