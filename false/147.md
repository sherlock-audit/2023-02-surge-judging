# Borrower can call `getCurrentState()` to make the interest can't be accrued

## Summary
The `interest` is updated based on the duration between 2 consecutive function call `getCurrentState()`, which can be abused by attacker to bypass the interest 
 
## Vulnerability Detail
The `interest` is calculated in function `Pool.getCurrentState()` as follows: 
```solidity=
uint _interest = _totalDebt * _borrowRate * _timeDelta / (365 days * 1e18); // does the optimizer optimize this? or should it be a constant?
```
In case `totalDebt * _borrowRate * _timeDelta < 365 days * 1e18`, the `_interest` will get 0 value. Since the `lastAccrueInterestTime` is still set to `block.timestamp` even if the `_interest = 0`, the borrower can abuse this by calling function `Pool.getCurrentState()` in each block minted to make the `interest = 0` for the debt. 

With some tokens which has the big value and small decimal, it will be worth for the borrowers to pay the gas cost to call the function in each blocks rather than taking the interest. 

Note that, users can't directly call function `Pool.getCurrentState()` because it is a private function. But the user can call `Pool.removeCollateral(0)` instead to accrue the interest and no need to remove any their actual collateral 

## Impact
The borrower can bypass the interest

## Tool used
Manual review 

## Recommendation
Use one more storage variable to store the timestamp which the `_interest != 0`. And use this variable to determine the deltaTime in interest calculation instead of `lastAccrueInterestTime`.
