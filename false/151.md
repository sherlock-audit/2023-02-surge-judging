# Add Zero Address Check in Factory Contract's Constructor for operator address

## Summary
The Factory contract's constructor should include a zero address check for the operator address. 

## Vulnerability Detail

If the operator address is set to address(0), future operations such as setting the fee recipient or fee, or changing the operator will not be possible. This can cause issues for the deployed pool using this factory contract, requiring redeployment.

## Impact

The impact of this vulnerability is medium. While it may require re-deploying the Factory Contract and already deployed pool using this factory contract, it does not pose a severe security risk.

## Code Snippet

### Factory.sol

[Github link to code](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-surge/blob/main/surge-protocol-v1/src/Factory.sol#L21-L24)

```solidity  
constructor(address _operator, string memory _poolSymbolPrefix) {
        operator = _operator;
        POOL_SYMBOL_PREFIX = pack(_poolSymbolPrefix);
    }
```


## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

To fix this vulnerability, add a zero address check in the constructor, as shown below:

```solidity  
constructor(address _operator, string memory _poolSymbolPrefix) {
        require(_operator != address(0), "Factory: Zero address not allowed for operator");
        operator = _operator;
        POOL_SYMBOL_PREFIX = pack(_poolSymbolPrefix);
    }
```
