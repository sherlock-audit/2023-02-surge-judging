# Use of `roundUpCheck` used in `borrow` and `repay` can result in Borrower have to pay more for 1 extra share

## Summary

While calculating `tokenToShares` in `borrow` and `repay` methods, `roundUpCheck` are used which result in Borrowers have to pay for 1 extra share while repaying.

## Vulnerability Detail

In `borrow`, `roundUpCheck` used is true. It means that the `debtSharesBalanceOf` of the Borrower will be added by lets say `x` for borrowing `z` amount.

But as in `repay`, `roundUpCheck` used is false, So the borrower will be able to only `x-1` debt shares for same `z` amount.

## Impact

Borrower will have to pay for 1 extra share.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
File: Pool.sol

480:    uint _shares = tokenToShares(amount, _currentTotalDebt, _debtSharesSupply, true);

528:    _shares = tokenToShares(amount, _currentTotalDebt, _debtSharesSupply, false);

```

## Recommendation

It is tough issue to mitigate. Only way the issue can be solved is to do a pre calculation in frontend such that user can add amount which results in an integer value so that round up or down will result in same value.
