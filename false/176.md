# Precision Loss can be large because of using Multiplication after Division in `Pool.getCurrentState`

## Summary

Used Multiplication on the division value which results in large precision loss.

## Vulnerability Detail

In `getCurrentState` method of `Pool.sol`, calculation is done to calculate the `fee`. In Line 154, `_interest` is calculated by dividing the numerator by time duration. The net result is multiplied by `_feeMantissa` which can result in large Precision loss in the value of `fee`.

## Impact

Large Precision loss.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
File: Pool.sol

154:    uint _interest = _totalDebt * _borrowRate * _timeDelta / (365 days * 1e18);
161:    uint fee = _interest * _feeMantissa / 1e18;

```

## Tool used

VS Code

## Recommendation

Recommend to mitigrate the issue by mulitplying all the numerators first and then divide it with the denominator.
