# Wrong formula for utilisation

## Summary
Wrong formula for utilisation is used, leading to bad accounting and unintended behavior.
## Vulnerability Detail
Utilisation in the code is calculated as total_debt / (total_debt + collateral). This formula can never reach 100%. 
If there is, for instance, collateral ratio of 1/10 (1 of collateral allows 10 of debt) and maximum debt is used (i.e. 100% utilisation) with collateral of 1, this would make utilisation = 10 / (10+1) = cca 91%.
If there is 10 debt against 10 collateral, which, with collateral ratio of 1/10, should be 10% utilisation, the result of the used formula will be 50%.
## Impact
The lending not working as intended.

## Recommendation
The correct formula for is utilisation = debt / (collateral / collateral_ratio). Or more clearly utilisation = debt / (collateral * inverted_collateral_ratio).
