# transferFrom does not emits Approval event

## Summary

Events should be used for off-chain trackings and for important changes they should be emitted.

## Vulnerability Detail

## Impact

```transferFrom``` function adjusts allowance, but does not emit Approval event for tracking the allowances off-chain

## Code Snippet

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-surge/blob/main/surge-protocol-v1/src/Pool.sol#L284-L293

```solidity
    function transferFrom(address from, address to, uint amount) external returns (bool) {
        require(to != address(0), "Pool: to cannot be address 0");
        allowance[from][msg.sender] -= amount;
        balanceOf[from] -= amount;
        unchecked {
            balanceOf[to] += amount;
        }
        emit Transfer(from, to, amount);
        return true;
    }
```


## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

emit ```Approval``` event after ```transferFrom``` is triggered.
