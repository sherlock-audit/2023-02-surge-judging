# The Pool#`tokenToShares()` called within the Pool#`borrow()` would always return `0`, which lead to a bad situation that the `debt shares balance` of a borrower would be always `0`

## Summary
Due to lack of logic to assign the proper value (the total amount of debt shares) into the `debtSharesSupply`, the `debtSharesSupply` would be always `0`. As a result, when the Pool#`borrow()` would be called, `0` would be always assigned into the `_debtSharesSupply` and therefore the Pool#`tokenToShares()` would always return `0` within the Pool#`borrow()`. 

This lead to a bad situation that the `debt shares balance` of a borrower would be always `0` despite the borrower actually borrowed the amount of loan tokens.

## Vulnerability Detail
Within the Pool, 
the `debtSharesSupply` would be defined to store the total amount of debt shares like this: 
(NOTEï¼šThe initial value assigned into the `debtSharesSupply` would be `0`)
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-surge/blob/main/surge-protocol-v1/src/Pool.sol#L38
```solidity
uint public debtSharesSupply;
```

Within the Pool#`borrow()`,
the `debtSharesSupply` would be assigned into the `_debtSharesSupply`. Then, the `_debtSharesSupply` would be assigned into the Pool#`tokenToShares()` and the `_shares` will be returned from there. After that, the `_shares` would be assigned into the `debtSharesBalanceOf` and the `debtSharesSupply` like this:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-surge/blob/main/surge-protocol-v1/src/Pool.sol#L472
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-surge/blob/main/surge-protocol-v1/src/Pool.sol#L480
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-surge/blob/main/surge-protocol-v1/src/Pool.sol#L484-L485
```solidity
    function borrow(uint amount) external {
        ...
        uint _debtSharesSupply = debtSharesSupply;  /// @audit 
        ...

        uint _shares = tokenToShares(amount, _currentTotalDebt, _debtSharesSupply, true);  /// @audit
        _currentTotalDebt += amount;

        // commit current state
        debtSharesBalanceOf[msg.sender] += _shares; /// @audit
        debtSharesSupply = _debtSharesSupply + _shares; /// @audit 
...
```

Within the Pool#`tokenToShares()`, 
the `_debtSharesSupply` assigned via above would be assigned into the `_sharesTotalSupply` parameter and it would be used for calculating the `shares` and return it like this:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-surge/blob/main/surge-protocol-v1/src/Pool.sol#L201
```solidity
    function tokenToShares (uint _tokenAmount, uint _supplied, uint _sharesTotalSupply, bool roundUpCheck) internal pure returns (uint) {
        if(_supplied == 0) return _tokenAmount;
        uint shares = _tokenAmount * _sharesTotalSupply / _supplied;  /// @audit
        if(roundUpCheck && shares * _supplied < _tokenAmount * _sharesTotalSupply) shares++;
        return shares;
    }
```

However, within the Pool contract, there is no logic to assign the proper value (the total amount of debt shares) into the `debtSharesSupply`. Thus, the `debtSharesSupply` would be always `0`. As a result, when the Pool#`borrow()` would be called, `0` would be always assigned into the `_debtSharesSupply` and therefore the Pool#`tokenToShares()` would always return `0` within the Pool#`borrow()`. 

After that, `0` returned would be always assigned into the `debtSharesBalanceOf` and the `debtSharesSupply` within the Pool#`borrow()` above. As a result, the `debtSharesBalanceOf` of the caller (borrower) would be also always `0`.

## Impact
This lead to a bad situation that the `debt shares balance` of a borrower would be always `0` despite the borrower actually borrowed the amount of loan tokens.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Consider adding a logic to the Pool#`borrow()` that assign a proper value into the `debtSharesSupply` when the initial borrowing, meaning the Pool#`borrow()` would be initially called by an initial borrower.
