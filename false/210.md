# Protocol can be rendered useless if large number of pools are created

## Summary
pools array is not being emptied anywhere or no check on it rendering protocol unuseable.
## Vulnerability Detail
There can be DOS attack by creating a large number of pools by using factory.deploySurgePool method, as pools are not being emptied also there is no restriction on who can create a pool or not, so users may not be able to create new pools or there can be gas limit error while iterating over it.
## Impact
creating new pool functionality can be effected.
