# Deposit and Withdraw Can be Frontrun, changing the price that the user gets for their tokens

## Summary

The conversion rate for depositing and withdrawal is determined by the current borrow to collateral ratio on the pool. When somebody sends a deposit transaction into the mempool, you can frontrun their transaction with your own deposit. Their deposit boosts the price, and then you can immediately sell.

## Vulnerability Detail

In the `deposit` function, the shares you get is determined by:
`uint shares = _tokenAmount * _sharesTotalSupply / _supplied;`

1. User deposits
2. Attacker sees transaction in mempool. Puts their own deposit transaction beforehand
3. User deposits after attackers deposit
4. Attacker calls withdraw and sells at an immediate profit


## Impact
Without any slippage limits, almost all the tokens of the depositor gets drained.

##Recommendation

In other AMMâ€™s there are various slippage limits ranging from 0.5% to 2.5%. Surge should also implement a max_slippage in those functions.
