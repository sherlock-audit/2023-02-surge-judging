# Missing Zero Check in Constructor

## Summary
The vulnerability is in the constructor of the smart contract, where the operator misses a zero check.

## Vulnerability Detail
The constructor of the smart contract takes an address _operator as an argument and assigns it to the operator state variable. However, the constructor does not include a zero check to ensure that _operator is not the zero address. 

## Impact
The setFeeRecipient() and setFeeMantissa() functions can only be called by the operator, assigning the operator a valid Ethereum address.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
It is recommended to modify the constructor to include a zero address check for the _operator input parameter. This will ensure that the contract can only be deployed if a valid Ethereum address is provided.
