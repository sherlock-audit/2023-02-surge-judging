# [M-1] Consider using multi-sig and time lock for `setPendingOperator()`

## Summary

Operator has too much privilege on function `setPendingOperator()`.

## Vulnerability Detail

In `Factory.sol::setPendingOperator()`, the operator can set a pending operator all by herself/himself. It is possible for an attacker to trick the operator to sign a malicious transaction and the attacker would become the pending operator, and then elevate to operator via `acceptOperator()`.

Consider using a multi-sig architecture to reduce operator's privilege. Also a time lock might be added so that the operator has time to react if something malicious happens.

## Impact

Attacker could trick operator to sign malicious transaction and become pending operation, then elevate to operator.

## Code Snippet

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-surge/blob/main/surge-protocol-v1/src/Factory.sol#L70-L73

```solidity
    function setPendingOperator(address _pendingOperator) external {
        require(msg.sender == operator, "Factory: not operator");
        pendingOperator = _pendingOperator;
    }
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Use multi-sig architecture and time lock for the function `setPendingOperator()`.
