# Division rounding can cause zero interest and fee

## Summary
Some ERC20 tokens are not 18 decimals and can result in zero interest

## Vulnerability Detail
consider this situation as an example:

- borrowRate = 20 percent (max) = 0.2 = 2e17
- timeDelta = 1 second (normal to have trx every second)
- totalDebt = 100 tokens (6 decimals) = 100e6

`_interest = _totalDebt * _borrowRate * _timeDelta / (365 days * 1e18)`
`_interest = 100e6 * 2e17 * 1 / (365*24*3600 * 1e18)  = 2*1e8 / 3*1e8 = 0'
'fee = _interest * _feeMantissa / 1e18 = 0'

## Impact
Some tokens will have no interest or fees gathered (most of the time)
