# Single admin role can be risky

## Summary
If the admin's account is compromised or the admin becomes malicious, they can potentially cause significant damage to the smart contract, such as disabling incoming fees as described in this vulnerability. 

## Vulnerability Detail
A malicious or compromised admin can either provide non-existing addresses or set the feeMantissa variable to 0 using these functions, effectively disabling incoming fees from all created pools.

## Impact
The setFeeRecipient() and setFeeMantissa() functions in the smart contract are admin controllable and can be called anytime. If a malicious or compromised admin gains control of these functions, they can either provide non-existing addresses to the setFeeRecipient() function or set the feeMantissa variable to 0 using the setFeeMantissa() function, effectively disabling incoming fees from all created pools. This vulnerability could potentially result in a loss of revenue for the smart contract creator.
