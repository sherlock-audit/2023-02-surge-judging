# Wrong assumption, not all tokens have 18 decimals

## Summary

Protocol assumes that all ERC20 tokens have 18 decimals. Accounting functions will be greatly impaired.

## Vulnerability Detail

In [Pool.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-surge/blob/main/surge-protocol-v1/src/Pool.sol#L26) contract it is thought that all EPC20 tokens are 18 decimal.
Not all tokens have 18 decimals, for example USDC have only six, this means that it will be dividing the amount by 18 but it should be only divided by 6.
If decimals is fixed at 18, there will be extreme accounting error.

## Impact

Massive impact on interest rate calculation. Truncation to zero possible.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

We recommend the protocol scale the token decimal in different matter to make it compatible with token that has more or less than 18 decimals.
