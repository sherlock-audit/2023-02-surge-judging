# Risk of transfering tokens on behaf of somebody - risk of loss of tokens

## Summary
The pool has an external function `transferFrom` which allows any spender to transfer on behalf of anybody. It lacks checking for the allowance.
 
## Vulnerability Detail
1 - The function `transferFrom` is external. 
2 - There is an `approve` function on t he contract that stores the `allowance` for an `spender` to spend on behalf of someone.
3 - But on the function `transferFrom` the `allowance` is never checked before the transfer takes place.
4 - Anyone can call `transferFrom` and make a transfer from an address `from` to the address `to` for all the `amount` that `from` has.

## Impact
Anyone can transfer Pool Tokens on behalf of anybody. It can cause huge loss of funds.

## Code Snippet
[Pool.sol#L284](`https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-surge/blob/main/surge-protocol-v1/src/Pool.sol#L284`)

```solidity
    function transferFrom(address from, address to, uint amount) external returns (bool) { 
        require(to != address(0), "Pool: to cannot be address 0");
        allowance[from][msg.sender] -= amount;
        balanceOf[from] -= amount;
        unchecked {
            balanceOf[to] += amount;
        }
        emit Transfer(from, to, amount);
        return true;
    }
```
## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Before making the transfer (i.e. updating the balances), check for the `allowances` amount first. That can be done by adding an require statement: 
```require( allowance[from][msg.sender] > amount, "spender not allowed to transfer that amount");``` 
like described below:

```solidity
    function transferFrom(address from, address to, uint amount) external returns (bool) { 
       require(to != address(0), "Pool: to cannot be address 0");
+      require( allowance[from][msg.sender] > amount, "spender not allowed to transfer that amount");
       allowance[from][msg.sender] -= amount;
       balanceOf[from] -= amount;
       unchecked {
            balanceOf[to] += amount;
        }
        emit Transfer(from, to, amount);
        return true;
    }
```
