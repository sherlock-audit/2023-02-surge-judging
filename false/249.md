# `_sharesTotalSupply` not clearly defined in contract

## Summary
The value for `_sharesTotalSupply` is not clearly defined in the contract. 

## Vulnerability Detail
The params mention that _sharesTotalSupply is the the total supply of shares of the pool. It is not clear how this figure will or should be derived to input into the function `tokenToShares` in `Pool.sol`. There is also no verification done to ensure that this input is correcly entered. 

This would affect the function `tokenToShares`, impact calculations to derive `shares` and `_shares`, and thereafter impact calculations and amounts that are dependent on them.

## Impact
See above.

## Tool used
Manual Review

## Recommendation
Clearly define how `_sharesTotalSupply` is/ should be derived and include checks to ensure that the amount input is correct.
