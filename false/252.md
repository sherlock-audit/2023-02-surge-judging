# Interest will not accrue properly for low decimal tokens

## Summary
Interest accrual will not work for pools with a low decimal `LOAN_TOKEN`.

## Vulnerability Detail

Interest is accrued in `getCurrentBalance`:

```solidity
File: src/Pool.sol
154:         uint _interest = _totalDebt * _borrowRate * _timeDelta / (365 days * 1e18);
```

The issue is that `totalDebt` is in `LOAN_TOKEN` decimals:

```solidity
File: src/Pool.sol
481:         _currentTotalDebt += amount; // @audit LOAN.decimals
...
496:         // interactions
497:         safeTransfer(LOAN_TOKEN, msg.sender, amount);
```

This means that if `LOAN_TOKEN` has low decimals, interest will be rounded to zero if the last accrual time was recent enough.

Let us take for instance a pool with `EURS` (2 decimals) as their `LOAN_TOKEN` on the `Polygon` blockchain. Let us suppose a borrow rate of `5e17` (50%) and a `_totalDebt` of `150k EURS`:

`_interest = _totalDebt * _borrowRate * _timeDelta / (365 days * 1e18);`
`          = 150e5      *   5e17      *     2      / (31536000 *  1e18)`
`          = 15e6      *   1e18                   / (31536000 *  1e18)`
`          = 0`

## Impact
Interest does not accrue properly for pools with low decimal tokens.
This is contingent on the total debt to be low enough, and is more likely to happen in chains with low block times (such as Polygon).
This is quite an issue as low-liquidity pools will essentially push depositors to exit (as interest accrual is lower than expected).

Manual Review

## Recommendation
The best way to tackle this would be to scale all the state variables tracking debt and deposits to 1e18 (`lastTotalDebt`, etc).
