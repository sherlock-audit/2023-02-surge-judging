## Summary

> ERC20: any

Some tokens (e.g. USDC, USDT) have a contract level admin controlled address blocklist. If an address is blocked, then transfers to and from that address are forbidden.

## Vulnerability Detail
There are currently 200+ blacklisted accounts by USDC, these accounts are related to known hacks and other crime events.

## Impact
Malicious or compromised token owners can trap funds in a contract by adding the contract address to the blocklist.

## Recommendation

Try to implement a try-catch solution where you skip certain funds whenever they cause the USDC transfer to revert.
