# Borrowers Can Open A Position That can be Immediately Liquidated.

## Summary

There is no gap between the maximum borrow ratio and the liquidation threshold. Therefore, users can open a loan which can be liquidated with the smallest price change.

## Vulnerability Detail

Almost every protocol has a maximum loan_to_collateral ratio which is less than the liquidation threshold. This prevents users from creating loans that will almost immediately be liquidated. These liquidations are bad not only for the user, but also increases the risk of bad debt to the protocol.

## Impact

Users may open positions that get almost immediately liquidated.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Create a different ratio for maximum borrow ratio which is different to the ratio used for liquidations.
