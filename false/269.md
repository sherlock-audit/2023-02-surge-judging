# the shares value might be incorrect if the _tokenamount was 0

## Summary
the shares value might be incorrect if the _tokenamount was 0 

## Vulnerability Detail
if the _tokenamount was zero it will cause such problems as division by zero because `        uint shares = _tokenAmount * _sharesTotalSupply / _supplied;
`
0*x = 0 / y => division by zero scenario 

## Impact
it can cause wrong logic calculations in shares value and can cause certain issues.
## Code Snippet

```solidity
 function tokenToShares (uint _tokenAmount, uint _supplied, uint _sharesTotalSupply, bool roundUpCheck) internal pure returns (uint) {
        if(_supplied == 0) return _tokenAmount;
        uint shares = _tokenAmount * _sharesTotalSupply / _supplied;
        if(roundUpCheck && shares * _supplied < _tokenAmount * _sharesTotalSupply) shares++;
        return shares;
    }

## Recommendation
consider adding require to prevent zero in amount
