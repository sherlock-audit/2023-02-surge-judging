# Low excess utils causes low interest accrual

## Summary

BorrowRate calculation is based on excess util. This can cause almost non-existing borrow rates even though in surge state.

## Vulnerability Detail

The function `getBorrowRateMantissa` calculates the borrowRate in surgeState like this:

```js
if(_util <= _surgeMantissa) {
    ...
} else {
    uint excessUtil = _util - _surgeMantissa;
    return (_maxRateMantissa - _surgeRateMantissa) * 1e18 * excessUtil / (1e18 - _surgeMantissa) / 1e18 + _surgeRateMantissa; 
}
```
If the excess util is very low the interest accrued over time will be very low as well. This can simply happen by someone borrowing up to the _surgeMantissa and then accruing interest one block later.

## Impact

Reduced yields

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Calculation of borrow rate probably should have a summand added as a constant instead of just being calculated as a fraction, something like `_surgeRate + x/y`
