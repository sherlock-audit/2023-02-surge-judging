# User cannot remove his full collateral if dust debt is remaining

## Summary
If the user tries to remove his collateral after he has paid debt, some dust amount may always remain because of the tokenToShares calculations. This will prevent him from claiming his full collateral.
## Vulnerability Detail
The if statement at Line 432 will pass even if there is a dust amount of debt remaining. Then the next line would revert if he is trying to withdraw full collateral, because of division by zero. This is especially a problem because Dust debt may remain even when the debtSharesBalanceOf(borrower) is zero, due to tokenToshares calculations based on so many variable parameters like currentTotalDebt and debtSharesSupply.

So he will not be able to repay that dust amount even if he wants to get userDebt = 0 because of the repay function reverting at Line 533 due to underflow.

## Impact
Some amount of collateral of a borrowers may always be stuck in the contract.

Manual Review

## Recommendation
Add another if branch to the removeCollateral logic where if debtSharesBalanceOf(borrowers) is zero then transfer the entire collateralBalanceOf(borrower).
