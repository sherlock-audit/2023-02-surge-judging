# [M-3] `_maxCollateralRatioMantissa`  should have an upper bound

## Summary

`_maxCollateralRatioMantissa` should have an upper bound, such as 75%.

## Vulnerability Detail

Most protocols are over-collateralized for self-protection.

There is no upper bound for `_maxCollateralRatioMantissa` in the contract. When a pool is created with a high `_maxCollateralRatioMantissa` such as 99%, the protocol will become under-collateralized.

## Impact

Protocol may become under-collateralized.

## Code Snippet

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-surge/blob/main/surge-protocol-v1/src/Pool.sol#L63

```solidity
require(_maxCollateralRatioMantissa > 0, "Pool: _maxCollateralRatioMantissa too low");
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Add another `require()` statement, such as:

```solidity
require(_maxCollateralRatioMantissa < 0.75e18, "Pool: _maxCollateralRatioMantissa too high");
```
