# State changes in a single block.timestamp are not taken into account

## Summary

See `Vulnerability Detail`.

## Vulnerability Detail

The current collateral ratio highly depends on the loan token balance which is changed multiple times withing a single block.timestamp (can be changed via a flashloan as well) but is not taken into account in Pool.getCurrentState because of the timeDelta check.

## Impact

Wrong tracking of the current collateral ratio.

## Code Snippet

```solidity
 // 2. Get the time passed since the last interest accrual
uint _timeDelta = block.timestamp - _lastAccrueInterestTime;

// 3. If the time passed is 0, return the current values
if(_timeDelta == 0) return (_currentTotalSupply, _accruedFeeShares, _currentCollateralRatioMantissa, _currentTotalDebt);
```

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation

Remove the check from the code snippet and update the `_currentCollateralRatioMantissa` no matter the time.stamp.
