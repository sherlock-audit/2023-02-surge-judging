# Repay function can be DOSed

## Summary

Repay function can be DOSed

## Proof of Concept

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2023-02-surge/blob/main/surge-protocol-v1/src/Pool.sol#L504

1. Alice(borrower) wanna repay all of her debt with 500 A token. 

2. Attacker notices her transaction for repay, the attacker repays with borrower address(Alice's address) 1 A token with much higher gas price(frontrunning)

3. Attacker repaid 1 A token, deptSharesBalanceOf[Borrower] of Alice will be underflowed, since the solidity compiler version of this contract is over 0.8.0, the transaction will be automatically reverted.

## Impact

Make borrower won't be able to repay debt.

## Tool used

Manual Review

## Recommendation
